Fran was absolutely gracious and welcoming. Made my stay a great experience. Would definitely recommend this cozy and peaceful place to anyone.
A comfortable room in a smart condo development. Everything was kept very clean and I had the use of my own bathroom. Sujatha and her husband are great hosts - very friendly and accommodating. I'll be staying here again.
"esta ubicado frente al barrio chino, se encuentran lugares de comida cerca y comercio, llegamos a los jardines de la BahÃ­a en 15,o 20 min caminando excelente ubicaciÃ³n"
The location is very convenient
The apartment is simple yet has everything you need. Very comfy beds and a nice spacious living area. You cant beat the location both with its proximity to Chinatown and the MRT.
"Great location easy access to malls, MRT and food and shopping places. everything is a walking distance. Great value for group travels."
"Super great location! Near the chinatown mrt so it has multiple train lines. chinatown hawker and a mall is just across the street.
The place is clean overall, exactly as it looks in the photos. While you need to take the stairs going to 29th floor, it__ no problem at all"
"We booked this because we needed a place to fit 3 people, it was tough to find such accommodation in Singapore for a reasonable price but this Airbnb exceeded all expectations. Host was quick to respond and easy to communicate and even allowed early checkin. We actually got a whole apartment to ourselves which was unexpected. Complete with a couch, dining table, ironing board, great fast wifi, fridge, washing mashine. They even had international adapters.

Everything about this place was excellent. Literally the MRT stops right in front of the place (take exit D at Chinatown). It__ on a high level and has a nice view as well. 

I will definitely book this place every single time I__ back in Singapore. Thank you!"
Convenient location
"Thank You so much for hosting us! This place is located right after coming out from Chinatown Exit D which is super convenient. I loved how pretty and organised this space is (especially the coordinated pink bedsheets)! Also, there were so many necessities provided, and also netflix - I am amazed! Definitely will be back again :-)"
Location is the selling point. And great choice for families groups as can fit up to 14 pax. We are quite satisfied with our group__ stay.
It__ perfact place. We could have comfortable time. thank you.
"Great location and great view of Singapore from Chinatown. Very convenient to take the MRT as it located next to Chinatown station. It is the best accommodate choices for a large room.

I would highly recommend this to my friends."
nice
Great Place
"This Airbnb is amazing for large groups. Maybe for 14 people it can be a little tight, but there is still enough place for everyone. The rooms are very big and clean anf the view is amazing. You have three balconys in different directions.
It all finishes with an awesome location in Chinatown. You are on the 28th floor at the top of the building, what even improves the view and is why you have no troubles during night with the noise. Great possibilities to eat right next to the building. Jaden looks after you and has great suggestions.
We were more than happy. THANK YOU"

"Great location, mins away from the train station. The house can fit 14 pax comfortably. Recommended for big group!"
"We had a 3 nights stay with 6 pax. Very spacious, clean, comfortable, and quiet. The place is on the last floor which gives a great view from the 3 balconies. The location is fantastic with MRT literally down the building, grocery store in mall across the street, 5 minutes to the heart on chinatown, and taxi station a step away.
Host is extremely responsive and accommodating. Previous guests damaged the iron sole and it got replaced couple of hours later with plenty of apologies for not having seen my message earlier.
Overall a great stay and would recommend the place."
"The location of the AirBnB was excellent for scouting out those great fooding spots in the Singapore Chinatown, as well as prime location from the MRT so you can access the entire rest of the city! The abode was also quite spacious and clean, great for the suggested number of people. Would highly recommend to any group!!"
nice! no regrets booking this homestay.
Good
"Very convenient location, the MRT is right below.  A lot of food choices near by.  Very big apartment with 7 queen size beds, clean, simple style."

"Great location, next to Train station. Spacious and private, recommend to stay if you are coming in a big group, 7 queen bed in total."
"Great homey place right in the heart of Singapore. It__ clean, comfortable, and with everything you need at home. Great with kids and even large families.

Very accessible location. Chinatown MRT station at the basement of the bldg where you can access most of the tourist spots. Outside the bldg are a lot of food shops and nearby malls, souvenir shops, and tourist spots.

Jaden and the team are very helpful with tips and assistance when needed. We had a great stay and would gladly recommend this place to all family and friends. "
"This property was very clean, spacious, and was in the perfect location to all local attractions of Singapore. I__ would recommend anyone to stay here."

"Great location! At the heart of Chinatown, very close to countless dining spots including some of the famous ones like Tian2 at Maxwell and Hawker Chan__ Liao Fan Hong Kong Soy Sauce Chicken Rice (both 10 min walk). Chinatown/Downtown MRT right underneath. 2 taxi drop off locations nearby. Space very big to accomodate a large group (10 adults, 1 child, 1 toddler) without feeling we__e in each other__ way. Plenty of A/C units to keep indoors cool. Large fridge/freezer. Easy to get to Sentosa and Marina area. Host very responsive, accomodating, and helpful."
"An excellent location in Chinatown. Plenty of local shops and malls nearby. MRT Station is few steps away from the lobby entrance.
The apartment itself is clean, with ample space for a group of 12 adults. Everything is in tip-top condition.
Had a pleasant stay in the apartment."
This is one of the best Airbnb I__e ever had. Literally 10 seconds from MRT Station and a very nice place to stay. I honestly recommend those who travels in group to stay here. Love the way the host communicate to you as well. 10 out of 10.

"Good location, easy check in/out. Good communication. Thanks."
"Good things about this place:
1. Excellent location (next to Chinatown mrt) easy access to main tourism spots
2. Spacious home (we have 10 ppl, enough to fit all of us) 
3. Easy check in and owner response very promptly to my every question  appreciated for the good service.

Things to be approved:
1. There__ only 2 washroom so might take Long Q to bathe if you are travelling in large group.
2. The house located at very old building. You don__ expect much on the exterior of the place.
The cleanliness of the house can be improved. The sofa at living room is old and dirty, My skin get itchy after seated for more than 10 mins. The host provide basic shampoo for shower but the cleanliness can be improve. 
3. The balcony has good view to the city but we dare not to step out as it__ abit dirty and lack of maintenance. 
4. If you__e driving, the parking place can be complicated and pricey for the parking fees. 

Overall, it__ good for large group of ppl."
This apartment was spacious for our family of 6 and conveniently located above the MRT Chinatown station. We were also close to Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay. Regina & Co. gave very helpful instructions for check-in and were quick communicators. Great stay!

Nice apartment with comfy beds! Absolutely great location. Regina is very friendly and helpful.
"We are a group of 11 people and The place is better than expected. Really near the mrt and you can easily find food near the place. The host is nice to give us an early check in which is really helpfull if you come on morning flight. The place is sparkling clean, ac work, hotwater, toilet with water spray, etc. We used to stay around orchard and this place open our eyes that singapore is not only orchard :)...you can find local food at the market here. A must stay if you are in large group. Thanks"

Very spacious and nice place with three bathrooms available! Definitely suitable for a large group/ families. We had a fabulous stay! The host was very responsive and always answered our questions immediately. Great location! Thankyou for the great stay!

"The property is spot on in the middle of the hustle and bustle. It is very convenient to go around as MRT entrance is just downstairs and there is market and shopping centres right st your door. Recommended for travellers with big groups. 

Unit is also very clean when we checked in.

cons: toilet/bathroom could be upgraded better to become dry bathroom instead of current bathroom.

other than that would  definitely recommended to stay here"
"Great place and very strategic location, very near to mrt station, only a couple meters away... The host are very kind, helpful and responsive... Very recommended place for large group or family"
Wonderful place clean safe and great location. RECOMEND for family group.
A great place to stay... my family had a great time staying in the apartment especially where everyone can gather together.
"It was located in very useful place. From there you can shortly go anywhere which is famous for sightseeing.
The house is also good. Each room is wide and clean. The view from the balcony is also very luxurious at night."
"I had 10 people in my group and the place was big enough to fit all of us comfortably. The place was clean, self check in was easy. The apartment is located right next to the China town MRT station and there are many choices for food and restaurants nearby. If you want a place that is centrally located, then this is great. Host always responded to my queries promptly. Highly recommended."
"Great place with cool views. Spacious rooms and very comfortable. 
Very responsive to text. 
Great stay!"
"You can__ beat the location!  It__ near the station and almost everything you need.  The apartment is big enough for 10adults and 3kids!
Just need a bathroom upgrade and complete essential kitchen equipment.  Aside from that, my family enjoyed our stay!"
"Great location, very central and above MRT station so easy to get around. Perfect size space for large groups - we were 2 families of 4 plus grandparents and it was ideal for us"
"Its nice house. We are a big whole family, stay in this house is quite happy and very convenience."
Great location in China Town. Requires some walking to get to elevator from Taxi stand drop off location but overall great experience!

I made reservation on november. But in your system is on october.
great place!
"It seems that airbnb and reddoorz management is not syncing with each other for now, so be prepared anytime to be moved into somewhere else. If you are keen to use this place, it is better to booked directly on their website. It could be better if next time, the management of reddoorz can sync so that we got what we expect."
"This is easily one of the best hostels I've stayed in. Everything is super clean. The staff are incredibly friendly, and there's someone available at all hours of the day at the front desk. It's well air conditioned as well.

It's less than a 5 min walk to the MRT station, so it's ideal for exploring. Plenty of delicious food in the surrounding area.

I highly recommend anyone new to the area to stay here!"
Wonderful place
Great hospitality!!

Great location! Very close to MRT.
"I actually really enjoyed staying at this hostel. It__ in the perfect location because it__ so close to the MRT which made it so easy for me to get around. I can__ imagine if I hadn__ been near that. The room was very nice and clean, and the air conditioning felt SO good after being out all day in the heat. The breakfast was just cereal, milk, and bread you can toast and add jelly/butter. I thought it was good. Bathrooms weren__ bad, but the only problem I had was having space to put my clothes while I was in the shower. Overall I liked this hostel a lot."
"Overall: this was a decent place to stay in singapore on the cheap- bare minimum at a low cost

Pros: 
-Super close to the MRT station 
-Beds were clean and comfy 
-Free breakfast (toast & cereal)
-Cheap 
-Security (good sized lockers & door security system)
-A/C in rooms worked well 

Cons: 
-Door to my room sometimes didn__ work (would get jammed)
-Bathrooms were not very clean
-Staff weren__ very friendly or knowledgeable of the area 
-Pretty removed from downtown and not a lot to do in the surrounding area 
-Towels cost $ 
-Not very social (minimal common area/ place to hangout)"
Limit storage. Had to have luggage on my bed. Towels cost extra. (Please state clearly).
"Breakfast not great, just break and milk. 
Beds were uncomfortable, I could literally feel the springs beneath."
The area very close to the concert area and MRT Station
This has to be the worst hostel I've ever stayed in! Too many issues to name. I will not be staying there again.
Great place with great access to a lot of establishment. Very convenient location as it is situated by the subway. The ground floor is full of delicious local food.
"Well located place, security is on point, the view is excellent, the view at night from the windows was awesome, would recommend to anyone that is looking for a convenient place in Singapore, the host was also very kind communicative with me on any issues that I had. Super recommended!"
Great place to stay in Singapore! Optimal location and friendly staff make the stay very memorable.
"Hipster city is a hidden oasis in the midst of lively Boat Quay! The lounge was the perfect place to relax after sightseeing! Great coffee and snacks at all times! We felt like we had our own hotel room with the loft area to place our bags, change, etc. Very roomy and clean :)  There is a lot of noise coming from the club next door at night, but we were still able to sleep well and since it was during weekdays it was not for the whole night! Thanks Jason for being so nice and helpful! We would certainly stay here again if back in town!"
Good amenities and kept clean. Great location too!
For the price it is ok if you are just sleeping.
Kingston's place is great and close to the Braddell MRT. It's a nice location and convenient. Clean and spacious for the room you rent out.
Quiet and peaceful place to stay. Communication with host was pleasant. Room is clean and as advertised. Highly recommended.
"The room is great-- spacious, fridge, utensils, TV, A/C.  But the condo complex is amazing and green, trees, flowers, etc. The club house has ping pong, a full gym, a restaurant, and an olympic-sized swimming pool. There are two MRT stops in easy walking distance, putting the Singapore Botanic Gardens just one stop away. The MacRitchie Reservoir is a short walk and I highly recommend it. It's a free and well-maintained hiking trail with a TreeTop Walk, a real rainforest, wild monkeys, etc. The food center nearby the condo is excellent with plenty of cheap options and conveniences. The host is very helpful and a great communicator. I would definitely stay here again! Thanks, Kingston!"
"Clean apartment, pleasant stay."
"Staying at Kingston__ place for 10 weeks during my internship in SG, and would recommend it to long term travelers. 

Braddell View is a friendly and quiet community, and the location is quite convenient, only 8mins walking to Braddell mrt station. 

The master room is spacious and well equipped, also have my own bathroom which is super important for me haha. Housekeeper comes once a week.

Kingston and Mary are so nice and considerate! They even prepared a pair of home slippers for me haha so cute!!

Thanks for taking care of me!"
"Kingston and Mary are an adorable couple and amazing hosts. They went above and beyond to accommodate my crazy check-in timings (2 am!) and even for making sure my lost luggage was delivered safely. Kingston is an excellent communicator and is readily available. The place was clean and at 5 mins walking distance to a nice hawker center, 24/7 shops and MRT station. I wish I could stay at his place for my entire trip in Singapore. Excellent hospitality. I highly recommend!"
"Friendly host, comfy room"
Great location. Friendly people. Clean and Safe. Reccomended.
Good place to live in alone in case of business traveler . Centrally locates
"Very convenient and comfortable stay mainly because of Mr. Kingston's warm and kind hospitality. Truly appreciated. Thank you, sir."
Super Host!
"Kingston__ place is ideal for a short stay. The house is located in a lovely, quiet neighbourhood. The room is spacious and Kingston provides you with all the essentials that you will need for your stay including drinking water, toiletries, towel, blanket, cutlery, a fridge and TV to yourself and access to the pool and gym if you are staying awhile. He has very thoughtfully also put motion sensor lamps in his house so that if you are returning during the night you won__ struggle to move around and find your room. The room is extremely clean and well kept. The MRT station is very close by so it__ easy to get around, otherwise the area is just a 10 min cab ride from the main city spots. Kingston and his wife were lovely hosts and even though it was a shot two day stay I really appreciate their hospitality. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a budget friendly option in Singapore."
Had the best Airbnb experience!
"Kingston place is convenient to the MRT and the buses to go anyway around S'pore city.
The room is accurately that what you see on the App. Clean and tidy.
Close to a small local food court where you can get a quick and cheap meals until late.
Both Husband and Wife are very friendly,have good acknowledge of S'pore so they will able to help you with any enquirers for your travel around S'pore.
If I'm in S'pore again I would try and stay again at Kingston's place.
Thanks."
"Nice place and friendly host. Only issue was overwhelming Dettol-like smell which did not clear even after prolonged duration of keeping windows open. Otherwise, lovely place to stay. Would recommend this location to others"
It was good!
Clean and cozy with nice sharing area & receptionist
"Staff are all very nice
Environment is very clean but u need to bring your own shampoo and body wash
Location is very near to downtown and Chinatown 
Service is wonderful"
Good
This is a good location. Restaurants right next door. 15 from airport and 15 minutes from Sands Marina Bay. It a bit smaller but  well kept and service is great.
Acceptable place.
"Excellent place for travellers on a budget, the week connected location, the friendly staff and the easiest check in possible, makes for a great stay!"
"I had a good stay here. It's easy to access food places nearby, MRT and bus station, convenience store."
"Great place to stay for the price point. A heads up, be sure to bring your own outlet converter. This hostel does not have Type A/B plugs found at most hostels in the area."
Highly recommend for you guys
"Nice budget hostel, it's worth every penny, but remember bring a travel adaptor plug or you'll have to buy it there."
A good value for money place to stay in
"A nice place to stay for budget traveller. The location is great, near MRT station and halal stalls"
Good place.
Amazing experience 
Best budget hotel for travellers and tourist.
Not a bad place to stay. But mind that it maybe noisy at night due to dorm environment.
"Pour ce prix _ Singapour, on ne peut pas vraiment s__ttendre _ mieux ! Le staff est nÃ©anmoins trÃ¨s sympa et dans l__nsemble les chambres sont plutÃ´t propres. Juste un petit dÃ©faut tout de mÃªme : certaines parties communes et les douches sont pas toujours propres. Sinon, je recommande _ ce tarif Ã©videmment "
"About what can be expected from a hostel. A lot of people in one room, so the people in there would probably make or break the stay. A good handful of people were there for long-term, Singaporean people who don__ have other homes to go back to, so not your typical young backpacker type. Breakfast was pretty basic but hit the spot. Showers were alright, but there weren__ many good spots to put my clothes, which was a bit annoying, so they always ended up getting wet. You can rent a towel, for a couple dollars. There__ AC in each of the rooms, with 2 fans, but the back fan in my room broke so it was very hot on side of the room, which made it hard to sleep. Overall was an alright stay, was very cheap, so good value I suppose. Location waa pretty good, 15-20 min walk to Haji Lane/Bugis/Library."
"This was my personal experience here as to keep in mind. The door was broken when I arrived - I was able to just turn the handle and walk in without having to use my key.  The staff had it repaired the following day, which was great.  The staff were welcoming and friendly. The bathroom on the other hand was a mess. There was more commonly than not urine on the toilet seats or the floor. I had observed feces on the door frame in one of the toilet rooms. There was mildew on the walls in the shower rooms.  The rooms were ok. They did their job, there was hair all over the floor in the female room though.  I also did witness a staff member re-fold a used blanket after a girl had checked out instead of changing it.  It's cheap; but you get what you pay for."
It is ok if you just need a place to sleep over during short visit.
Great location for the value
We had a great stay at this Airbnb. The location is perfect if you're visiting singapore and want to go around. It's near the bus stop and mrt station.
"The complete living area was really clean. You share the common rooms like the living room and the kitchen with other guests.
The host was really helpful and supported us on every request. I really can recomment this accommodation."
Very comfortable stay and felt at home. The place is very near to the bus stops which can access the city. Teddy and his sister in law are very accomodating. Will definitely book this place again.
"Teddy is such a great host who responses to our queries pretty quickily. The self-check in door coding system is a plus particular for those who are on odd travelling schedule,. We touched down SG at wee hours due to flight delayed, and as soon as we turned on our phone, we received the notification thru both sms and msg on airbnb app from Teddy for the door passcodes as well as the picture of his building which eased our time in searching and finding. How thoughtful and efficient! 

His place is very clean and quiet and is coveniently surrounded with a number of foodie places and it__ just a 10min bus ride away to city centre. 

Thanks Teddy! We will definitely stay here again when we travelled to SG next time!"
"Wonderful place, room has everything you would possibly need! Teddy is great host, nothing was problem to him, he even helped us store our luggage after check out until our flight out of Singapore. Really great experience. Go for it and you will not be dissapointed!"
"We are a family with 3 kids. It's quite hard to find a complete homestay with affordable price but i'm glad i made the right decision to choose Mr Teddy's place. plus it is a convenient air conditioned room, with private bathroom, shared kitchen n washing machine + dryer which are very useful to us. We are looking forward to come back here next time."

Teddy is very nice, he will show you all the best dishes and restaurants that you can find 2 mins from the house. I will definitely stay there again as soon as I get the chance to come back to Singapore."
A really great place. Nearby a bus stop can go to other MRT stations. Clean. Helpful housekeeper. Nice kitchen view with complimentary coffee and tea. No complaint.
"Great location, friendly host, good value."
Teddys ist sehr freundlich und die Kommunikation mit ihm hat sehr gut geklappt. Das Appartement ist wie auf den Bildern. Das Bett ist gemÃ¼tlich und der TV ist ein Smart TV mit Internet-Anbindung. Das Appartement ist 1 min von einer Bushaltestelle entfernt und in ca. 25 min ist man vom Appartement an alles wichtigen SehenswÃ¼rdigkeiten der Stadt. Der Aufenthalt hat uns sehr gut gefallen.
it's a superb place. very near to public transport
Definitely would come back at Teddy__ place again for my next trip. The cleanliness is really good. You could compare staying here with a hotel room but with better price value.
Teddy is a good host with quick replies to my queries over (Hidden by Airbnb) . His place has all the amenities and is clean. He also made arrangements for my husband's birthday with cake. We also found a Indian restaurant nearby to eat.

"A wonderful Airbnb experience. Teddy is a great host. Extremely responsive at all times, even when I was having a medical emergency at night. The place is very clean and well maintained. The bed is comfortable and the kitchen is nice. A major plus for us was the computer and laundry! We loved the amenities. Thanks again for the great hospitality Teddy, we really appreciate you!"
"The place is perfectly located that you need least walking to bus stations, hawker centers, restaurants, and shops. Overall, Teddy's place is a good choice for travellers in SG. Indeed, the place is cozy and clean. I highly recommend his place. Would love to stay here again."
"Great host, great communication."
"This is a place more than you can just stay and sleep. It is a home. Teddy's family is very welcoming and understanding. We had little hard time before and during our 1st day of stay but they helped and guided us to get a good vacay. The host is easy to communicate with and online most of the time. The unit and the whole house is decent, near to stores, restaurants, and bus stops. Thanks Teddy and to your family! Hope we can stay at your place when we fly to Singapore again."

"Good palace, Teddy responds really fast"
"Teddy__ place is value for money. Those are who are planning to use public transport in Singapore, for them it is very well connected location."
"Everything as described, very good hospitality, nice co hosts."
"The host is friendly. This place is clean, convenient. Surrounding is quiet. I like this place. I will choose it if I have a chance to come back there."
Teddy is really good landlord . Help with everything . I haven't have chance to met him in person . But he's always reply Fast . The room is clean . Location is good too ( bus stop 1 min walk ) . I had very good stay in there
"Teddy ist sehr aufmerksam und freundlich. Seine Antworten dauern niemals lange. Er ist sehr hilfsbereit. Das Bett war sehr bequem und das Zimmer fÃ¼r den gÃ¼nstigen Preis und die perfekte Lage echt zu empfehlen. Wer schnell aufgrund von GerÃ¤uschen wach wird, benÃ¶tigt OhrenstÃ¶psel, da die WasserleitungsgerÃ¤usche aus den anderen Zimmern etwas lauter sind. Uns hat das nicht gestÃ¶rt!"
Teddy is a great host who attends to your needs readily. Place is kept clean and quiet
"åº_¸»__,äº¤é__ä¾"
evry thing met my expectation
"Great place and very friendly host.  The location is perfect with a bus stop just 1 minute away.  Good aircon, wifi and clean.  Highly recomend!"
"Teddy's place very cleaning and small, But Good...."
"A good place for a short stay if you plan to explore around most of the day! 
Teddy__ response was always fast and no issues finding the place and checking in at all."
"The place is Great, the room and toilet are clean! bed sheets are clean, i can enjoyed my stay! but you will need to expect it was a little far from MRT, bus stop is near front of the road.
the place is quiet mostly but only when was my visit it there was construction in area, so it was noisy but not in the night. the room not really soundproof but there's always quiet in time. thankyou for provide me place to stay for my visit! thanks for being great host! thankyou for lending me android cable because i forgot to bring it. overall it was a good place to stay!"
"Choosing Teddy's place is definitely one of the best choices that I made during my trip in Singapore. The room is very clean and fully equipped. Although it's a bit far from the city center, it's located quite close to the bus station, which makes it fairly easy to take the subway. Teddy was quite accommodating and responsive, and he provided me with lots of tips about living here. It's also surrounded by a couple of stores and restaurants. I would still go back here if I travel to Singapore again"
"The owner is really nice, and his response is very quick. I really recommend to stay.

There are many restaurants around the place including some famous Singapore restaurants such as chicken rice and bak kit te.

You can use laundry, common kitchen, Wifi and PC. 

Moreover, the owner received the parcels before my arrival, which is very helpful."
"The host's responses were usually very fast when I needed something or help. It was easy to communicate with him and I felt more relaxed staying at this place because his office is just downstairs of the place. And the location of this place is accessible to almost everywhere in Singapore and also, the bus stop is just a minute away which was really convenient for me. There are cheers, a prata shop, cafe, and atm machine nearby the place. It was a relaxing and comfortable stay!"
"Everything is exactly as described. The room and the common area are clean and tidy. Checkin is very easy and communication with Teddy is fast and helpful.  Laundry machine and dryer are available for all guests. The location of Teddy's home is pretty convenient, bus stop some steps away, food stalls and supermarket nearby. I really enjoyed my stay."
Great value of money
"Great host, great location, great apartment! Sufficient enough for 4-5 person! Thanks Benny"
"My family and I had a great time at Benny's place, overall nice and clean apartment with lots of amenities. Will definitely come back again next time!"
Great place to stay
Value for money. Superb food choices and supermarket nearby.
Benny was very thoughtful and helpful.   Out of the 5 airbnbs we stayed in 3 countries he had the most thoughtful gestures and provided generously including Laundry detergent.
"Apartment on a 7th floor, nice and clean. I think for 4 person max, but it is possible 5. The swimming pool is fantastic, especially by so hot days! Nearby lot of small food courts! I do recommend this accommodation!"
"for muslim travellers, it is near with halal restaurant. benny is so responsible, will book this place again if we are going to singapore."
"Great apartment. Super clean. We were a family of four and comfortably fit in. The elevator was convenient. The beds were comfortable. The apartment had a washing machine and a small balcony to dry our clothes. That was a big plus for us. The fridge and small kitchen were very useful. This place was a great value for money. Close to bus stops. Not too far from the Aljunied MRT station. There were plenty of wonderful places to eat within walking distance including the famous Old Airport Road food center. A downside for us was that the apartment was in the red district and neighbored some brothels. They didn't publicly display their services and respectfully left you alone though so problem there. We wish the whole business was illegal. We have heard that the government is working on shutting them down.

Benny was a great host. He was helpful and communicated well with us."
"Great place to stay. Great host, fast response, very clean!"

Affordable price and a wonderful view.  Though need to walk a little to get to the nearest mrt station. Bus station however is just a stone throw away.  Thank you Benny you are a great host!
"Place is clean, everything is provided ( toiletries, tea& coffee and kitchen utensils for you to cook ) ,  just if you dont mind the location (located in red district area) this is a go to place fot a stay ,  there is food  around the area and convenience store is 100m away."
Wonderful place to stay for about 4-5 people
"Host Benny was very helpful in helping us accommodate to our needs, communication wise was quick and informative.

The area is filled with plenty to eat, some of which are 24 hours. 

Would definitely recommend this place and looking forward to staying here again in the future."
The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

A very clean and cozy apartment that is easy to get to the stadium or downtown

"hi benny, we thank you for the service. the room is very clean, comfortable and safe. I really like it, when I go on vacation to Singapore again. I will, to your place again sorry, I just got to know, because yesterday was in a hurry and too tired."
Very good value for money. 5mn walk from MRT. Excellent communication with the host. Ideal for a family of four staying in SG a few days.
"Nice appartment, very  well equiped, useful for a family as the kids  and parents beds are in 2 separate room."
"This place is exactly like the picture shown. Great location, easy access using public transport and sparkling clean. Recommended for 4 person."
"Very nice host, friendly and responding promptly to our questions. It surely was a pleasant stay in Benny__ apartment."
Small apartment but perfect to spend a couple of days in Singapore. Thank you!!
A very easy and a very good location. Host response very efficient. Lovely place. Restaurant and shopping is just on a walking distance. Taxi running just by the gate. Very safe place for families.
"Great location. In the middle of the city. Clean place, great value for money, great amenities."
"Nice place to rent if you are visiting for a few nights, Benny is very accommodating. Definitely recommended, good value for money."
The place is nice. 
"Place is really nice,in neighbourhood a lot of good restaurants"
"Benny is fast response, his service is good, every little thing is ready in the room. I suggest you to bring mineral water at the first time you arrive or you can boil water to drink. There's indian halal food and minimarket for 24 hours at T-junction of Lorong 20 and Geylang Road. Have fun in Singapore! Warm regard from Indonesia :)"
Not too far from Aljuneid mrt. Perfectly clean. Nice host.
A good place to stay. Quiet and safe environment . 10 min. walk to mrt. There are nearby grocery store and restaurants.
"The apartment is conveniently located close to lots of eateries. It is very small, quiet tight for our family of five. The place was clean and the kitchen well equipped. The pool on the roof is great. It is in the middle of the red light district, but it was not a big issue and still safe."
"Benny is very responsive, quick to answer my inquiries about the place. The flat is cozy, clean, and enough for four people to stay. We were allowed to leave our luggage earlier than the check in time. My parents slept well inside their room, the beds are comfortable. The tap water is also safe to drink, no need to boil it according to our host. It is located in the red district area but nothing to worry about because it is still safe to wander around even at night. There are nearby convenience stores and places to eat. It's a (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) min walk going to the train station but the nearest bus stop is around 5 min walk only. We always rode the bus with the help of (Hidden by Airbnb) map app, because it is more convenient for us. Definitely will recommend to other airbnb users. Thank you!"

"Benny is a great host. He replies quickly with questions about the listing/reservation. The place is clean. My nephews enjoyed the pool. The place's location was ideal as it was close to stores. I recommend Benny's place for future travel plans :). Thank you Benny, me and my family had a great stay in Singapore in part because of your place."
owner very nice and helpful.
I really like that place
"Great place! Near to everything (MRT, food parks, convenience store). Relatively safe neighborhood."
Benny was a good hosting and really quick in answering questions. His place easy to get access to public transport as what I expected. House conditions was clean as in picture. Only bathroom need little improvement. Thank you  Benny for your hospitality.
"Great place to drop your bags and explore Singapore. Sleeping arrangements fit my family of 5 comfortably.  Very close to attractions. Cost of taxi to attractions is very low. Great restaurant at the end of the road 2 minutes walk, for typical Indian cuisine and somewhere to get breakfast before starting the day. Water is drinkable in Singapore. Beds are very very comfortable and good air con. Would visit again."
Easily accessible. Amenities are good. Not too far off from mrt station. Felt safe staying here

"Great location in relative proximity to the city center.
The apartment is very compact, but at the same time everything is there.
Large refrigerator, washing machine with dryer and washing powder. There are necessary household trifles.
A small pressure of water.
The rooftop pool is in good condition and has a comfortable chlorine content. Usually no one is in the pool.
Communicating with Benny was very convenient, he quickly answered any questions and quickly eliminated a couple of household moments."
"Benny sangat komunikatif dan responsif pada saat Kami bertanya-tanya perihal Singapur, walaupun Kami belum memutuskan memesan tempat tersebut. Setelah pemesanan, Benny memberikan arahan yang jelas tentang lokasi apartemen tersebut. Apartemennya bersih, lokasi strategis dekat dengan Shelter Bus dan Stasiun MRT. Terima Kasih Benny telah membantu dalam liburan Kami sekeluarga."
"L'appartement de Benny est idÃ©alement situÃ©, dans un quartier animÃ© (resto, bars, magasins,...), proche des stations du MRT (EW et CircleLine). La piscine sur le toit est fantastique, avec une vue sur le coucher de soleil sur les buildings! Benny a Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s sympathique et trÃ¨s rÃ©actif lors de nos communications. Un super sÃ©jour _ Singapour!"
"Cool apartment to spend one night or two, as it is too small for 4 people: ideal for 2. The neighborhood is a bit low level, but well connected with bus and metro."
Great place to say. Apartment is exactly as advertised!
"10min walk from mrt. everything ok. clean, convenient."
"Clean and Cosy place, friendly host"

"great place and great stay, thank-you"
enjoyed my stay. would rate this a 3 star hotel.  rooms are no insulated from the road or the corridors so can be a little loud at times.
"A very sad and shabby establishment, which is very expensive for what it offers. One word about the staff that was super-nice, perhaps the only thing going for this place."
"Location is excellent and local foods is nearby and good.Like the resort feel style.Overall,I am happy to stay in this (Website hidden by Airbnb) not set high expectation,if want a cozy and relax place,this is the hotel to look for."
"Stylish and clean hotel! We choose the room with the balcony with the nice sitting arrangement, there__ a pool and gym for those in active lifestyle best of all free complimentary parking! Location wise is ok near all the food hawker and eateries"
Amazing location. Great hotel. Great service. Sweet infinity pool. Decently fast internet (though you have to re-log in every day and it doesn't work with Chromecast). Love the two water bottles every day. No complaints!
"Hotel room was clean, staffs were very friendly. The location wise you could instead of walking from Lavender MRT, take a bus from the MRT instead of walking as it'll take quite some time to walk there."
"The place is rather cosy with a mini balcony. The toilet is a little small and there wasn't any lock for the sliding door (but it's just two of us so it's okay) Location wise is sort of secluded but 
other than that, it's a good place to relax."
"Great room and staff, however, noise insulation from adjacent rooms and corridor was not so good."
Location is very convenient.  All sort of food and 7/11 is very nearby.
The private garden is a wonderful place to unwind after a long day 
A place you can call home but with ammenities of a hotel. Everything was perfect! Amazing location! Gracious host! We didn__ want to leave the place at all.
"Aki is very friendly and also super flexible. My boyfriend and I totally loved our stay at Aki__ place. Aki let us check in really early, and also let us check out late since we had a flight early in the morning.
The description and pictures  were just like when we got there.. super clean and also really walkable to any activities (like grocery shopping, sightseeing, restaurants and bars, etc.)

We both recommend Aki as your host!"
Comfortable & stylish place near to Orchard. Thank you for the hospitality!
Stylish house. Friendly host. Comfortable bed. Good location. Thank you Aki & Leo for the hospitality!
"Aki's apartment location is super. It closes to many popular places. I also like the way, Aki provide the flexibility for check-in and send her message. Try to reach Aki if you're looking for strategic place, but not want to be disturb by the pqck of people buzzing around."
there is privacy and the surrounding is good.
"Aki is very nice host, the room is very very nice. 
There are everything we need for staying including towels shower gel shampoo toothbrush, and Aki also put a lot of city guide for guest, also changeover plug, drinking water prepared in the room, very thoughtfully and warm welcome. 
The checkin process is very convenient, Aki contact us when we landed and help guiding us the transportation to get there. 
The location is also very good and central, 15mins to Clarke Quay, China town, Orchard Road. 
We__l stay with Aki again if we ever go to Singapore again."
"We had such a great experience in Singapore. Teddy__ place was so nice and exactly what we needed for our trip. He was great with telling us places to go, where to eat and how to get around the city. We definitely recommend staying there!"

The place is great! Highly recommended
"My mom and I enjoyed our stay at Teddy__. It was very convenient for us to self-checkin, as we landed after midnight. The room is in a good location__ery close to the bus station__ith plenty of shops around."
"We enjoyed our stay in Teddy's place. Teddy was very responsive to every question we had. The check-in was great as we got to his place around 2 AM and thanks to all the digital key locks, we were able to get in easily. The location was also great as the bus stop was right next to the building and also a bunch of restaurants and a hawker center around. 

The only thing that could be better is the mattress, as it was quite hard to sleep on, and both, me and my girlfriend woke up multiple times during the night because of that. Other than that, definitely recommending Teddy's place for any travelers."
"5/5 highly recommended, great for an affordable stay in Singapore, very clean, very comfortable"

"Wow!! This is what I felt when I first entered the room. Room was super nice with all the amenities that you can think of. Super close to 24 hrs restaurants, bus stops, etc. I slept nicely and njoyed my stay here. Teddy is such a nice person and very friendly. I would strongly recommend this place."
"The  place is a very cozy, quiet respite amidst the bustling city. It's very clean, and the amenities provide value for money."
"Teddy is wonderful person. what I like most - his prompt and coordinating response and action too for your every little requirements. we had good stay there; his place's location is other USP - Well connected with bus stop and MRT, just 2 mins walk away - Connecting Bus Stop which connects you with good attractions. Orchard Street, Marina Bay Sands, Bugis Junction, Little India are the places which is just 30-40 mins distance away. 

Teddy - We had pleasant stay at your place. Would love to recommend your place to my friends."
"Tedy's place was lovely. We liked our time in Singapore. The apartment has a very good location, it is close to a bus station where you can quickly get to the city centre. There are stores around. Tedy was very friendly and welcoming, communication was clear and nice. The room is small, but good enough for two people. The air conditioning in the room was just perfect! He also helped us to store our luggage for some extra hours. Thanks Tedy!"
"teddy and his family were great hosts and gave loads of local advice, helped with ordering taxis and storing luggage. the room is really small for 2 people, me and my sister could not both have our suitcases open at the same time so would have to take turns. Location is a 20min walk to closest MRT station and lots of bus stops outside. thanks for being a great host"
"Great host, many amenities and convenient to travel around."
"Teddy met us for check in and this was most helpful. He personally explained his home to us and this meant a lot! He showed us in  and how to use the locks, and even introduced us to the beautiful sitting room. Free laundry and free coffee make this place stand out from the rest, would definitely stay again, thanks Teddy!"
Teddy__ place was very clean and close to shops and food centre. He responded to our messages quickly. Convenient to travel around as the bus stop was very close by. We had a very pleasant stay.
Our stay at Teddy__ place was great! The room is enough for 2 person. Great location as well and Teddy is very prompt in responding to our queries. Highly recommended! Thanks Teddy!
The place is nice and clean. The host gives quick respond. His tips is very usefull. The most convenient is the place surrounded by restaurant and near Whampoa Market
"Le logement de Teddy est trÃ¨s propre et convient trÃ¨s bien si on ne compte pas cuisiner (en mÃªme temps, la nourriture est si bon marchÃ© _ Singapour pourquoi s'embÃªter ?).
Teddy est un trÃ¨s bon hÃ´te qui est _ l'Ã©coute et rÃ©pond quasiment instantanÃ©ment aux messages.
Le logement est assez loin du mÃ©tro. En revanche avec toutes les lignes de bus qui passent dans la rue, on peut facilement se dÃ©placer."
"Teddy is so friendly. The room is clean and surounding is quiet, i like it.   I__l choose this place again if i have a chance to come back :)"
Good placein a nice location.  Teddy is fast at responding and was nice enough to let me leave my suitcase after check out.
Great value!

Thanks a lot Teddy!"
"Nice, clean and easy access to all amenities."
"Teddy's place is really clean and has all the amenities that travellers need. Check in experience was superb, he even allowed us to store our luggage for few hours because our flight is at midnight. We love the cute pantry, complimentary washing machine, and the iron that are easily accessible because we were there for business trip. He is also very responsive. We would definitely stay again at his place."
Nice place to stay
"Convenient place to stay in Singapore. Very clean, good location."

"Teddy__ place is amazing. You are a 2 minute walk from a bus station and a hawker center. When you (Hidden by Airbnb) the best hawker centers in Singapore, it will most likely come up with Chinatown, Maxwell, or Old Airport Rd. I was in Singapore for almost a week and got to try them all several times. Whampoa (the hawker center right next to Teddy__ place) is BY FAR the best hawker center. I highly suggest the Mee Rebus or Mee Siam from a stall I believe was called __uriylah Malay Food_. I__ also recommend getting an MRT pass from the airport when you land because it__ the cheapest, fastest, and easiest way to travel around Singapore. You don__ have to worry about navigating it either if you download Regis app called __itymapper_. Anyways, back to Teddy__ place. The room is small but perfectly acceptable for the price. It has AC which is 100% necessary for the Singapore heat and there is a lot of security. I felt very safe in Singapore and at Teddy__ place. One note, you will probably be the only foreigners in the area unless you visit during peak tourism season. Teddy was a great help and responded quickly to any questions about the area we had. Best time ever!"
"Really enjoyed my stay at Teddy's. Great location and doesn't take long to get downtown. Close to the bus stop which will take you where you need to go or drop you off at the MRT. The place is located really close to Whampoa hawker center and many other great places to eat. 

Check in and everything was a breeze.  Teddy is very quick to reply if you have any questions or need anything. The room was cleaned often as well. The room sized worked well for me. I would absolutely stay here again."
"A cute convenient apartment close to the Novena area with close access ro several MRT stations,  bus stops and famous Whampoa hawker centre!"
"Jen  isn't a super host, she's a super PERSON. Always making sure I had enough stuff like toilet paper, shampoo, and offering lots of drinks, snacks, fruits, etc. About the room I was staying in. The private bathroom came was very nice so I didn't have to bother anyone whenever I wanted to brush my teeth or take a shower. The place is just a few minutes walk to the MRT, which of course has malls, food courts, and shops surrounding it. I will definitely come back here pending room availability =)"
"Near to MRT station, very convenient."
"I had a great time staying at Jens place. She picked me up from the train station on the day that I arrived. She had a lot of good tips about the things I might wanna see in my short time in Singapore, about the public transport. Always responding very fast, and a lot of good advise before I even left from the Netherlands. It 
She was always up for a nice conversation (with good food;) and always interested. If, no, when I go back to Singapore in a few years, I definitely get back in touch!"
Jen is really a superhost. She makes sure you feel very welcomed and does small touches that makes you feel like you are back at home. So motherly but still gives you your space. Near to mrt station and a big mall. Easy to (Website hidden by Airbnb) town and had many eateries.
Was a nice stay. All good and no complaints. Thanks.
fantastic stay
highly recomended
Good place to stay.
bon sÃ©jour
Nice place and cost-saving.
Raymond is very accommodating. The room is same as what you see in the picture. Location is walking distance to mrt and close to restaurants. We enjoy our stay.
"thx for linda n raymond, your place so clean n cozy, next time if i go there, maybe i will stay at your place again. thx"
"Good location, near MRT station"
Worth to stay
The place is clean. The host is helpful and nice. The communication is great. They help us provide extra bed. It's a reasonable price compare with others. The location is near everywhere and there's a lot of great street food nearby
Very clean and tidy
Not much to recommed
"Overall the stay at Raymond's place was okay. There were some lack of amenities from what was described, e.g., no cooking facilities, no microwave, no towels, 2 small hairdryer shared between 4 guest rooms, 2 bathrooms also shared between 4 guest rooms (each with about 3-4) guests. It felt more like living in a dorm/hostel with limited amenities. It was still quite affordable, location was quite good, close to restaurants, and communication was responsive."
Nice place to stay... very comfortable bedroom
Nice place to stay and wonderful host. Highly recommended.

Clean. Host very welcoming. Clean facility. Quiet. No towels. Extra charge for after hours check in took me by surprise. Might have been disclosed but I don't remember. Easy walk to MRT. Plenty of places to eat nearby.
"this apt is as basic as the pictures located in a full residential area, in a building on the 7th floor. it has AC which helps, washrooms and showers are shared, 2 of them, must wake up early as they're always busy.

i personally found the washrooms always fool of black hair, a little annoying, so I'd shower it down myself but still not pleasant.

the host charged me $20 for looking after my luggage which i found a little too ""money hungry"" but hey, it is what it is. whats another $20 in a country that's so unjustifiably overpriced.

internet works, couple of nice shops outside where one can eat and get some snacks. MRT station some 5 blocks away, 10 min walk to  ""Aljunied"". 

decent place to just put your head down somewhere then leave in the AM to visit. 

NO TV but Internet always worked. fridge available as well as some sort of kitched but can't be really used due to the lack of ustensiles.

enjoy."
great place to stay.
"very helpful and very fast response,a nice place to stay,comfy & homy"
Accessible to all.
"very nice place, cheap, good internet connection, communication fast and easy, close to many restaurants and shops."
"The place is clean, not too far from Aljunied MRT, easy to find local foods, host is very helpful and respond to your questions in a timely manner. Will be back again."
Everything is perfect.
Clean & in a convenient area walking distance from local eateries. But prepare to share bathrooms with others & sound can be heard thru very thin walls. Overall good value.
quick response
The appartament is located near metro station. For the price It__ a good choice.
"host is very hospitable and helpful. place is clean, size of the room is just right for the five of us. i like the cabinets because we were able to organize our things. location is good as well. there are many food centers around. Place is a bit far from the tourist spots but bus and mrt are accesible. Overall, me and the rest of my travel companions were satisfied with the service, accomodation, and location of the place. i will surely go back for my next visit in SG."

"Amazing place to stay, great!"
"Safe neighborhood, easy access to MRT. Shared bathrooms did get crowded."
"Nette Gastfreundlichkeit und Support des Gastgebers, nette saubere Zimmer. Leider keine eigene Badezimmer, aber aus meiner Sicht relativ sauber gehalten!"
"Nice place and host responds quickly with questions and concerns.   However the place is really just a glorified hostel.  5 rooms that all share 2 bathrooms, and no basic amenities such as towels."
"Personally i wouldnt recommend staying here. We had a terrible experience. First, we were not informed that there will be extra fees for children ages 2-4 years old. We also had to pay for luggages storage for an hour. Everthing was not clarrified  before our arrival. And the worst part was the day we had to leave we found out that we were locked from outside.  Someone must have locked it or the locked was damaged. Regarless, were not able to open it from inside. We were so scared and worried that we wouldnt make it on our flight on time.  Not to mention that we were in a diffrent country and we have kids with us.  Not really knowing whats going on. If there was a fire or accident, there was no way of us getting  out of that building.  Doors were locked and windows was padlocked as well.  They dont even have fire exit! We will not come back to this place again!"
"Great stay for a few days in Singapur, near to MRT"
The place is easy to access from the airport and great for an overnight stay. We recommend it.
"It__ not the cleanest AirBnb I__e been in (bed sheets had a couple stains, the drawers were dusty), but it__ cheap. Decent place if you just want to stay overnight to sleep and leave. The listing says basic toiletries are available, but bring your own. The shampoo, body wash, and hand soap provided are all the same product"
great
"Is cheap and ok. Too noise with big families in every room. You share toilets and there are no towels. In the morning there is fight to go to the toilets. If 4 or 5 people in every room, at least 15 people to take a shower and use toilet in the morning...a nightmare. There is no free parking arround."
nice place
"Cosy and convenient place if you plan to use MRT.
Good place to choose when exploring Singapore."
"Everythings as described, the share bathroom is a issue, make sure you get up earlier to get a bath before heading for sightseeing, oterhwise you will get stuck !"
Great place

"We thought we__l have whole apartment for us, but it was a shared apartment. We got a room with 2 beds and 2 extra bes for 6 of us. 

We were quite shocked when we arrived, but then we re-reading the house rules and it was stated there, so no problems 

So here__ some things you need to know about this accommodation:
1. This is a shared apartment with 5 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, don__ worry the room is quite big with super comfy beds!
2. The house is clean
3. They don__ provide towels and amenities, so make sure to bring your own
4. Although the apartment is old, it is located in a SUPER GREAT LOCATION, you can go to Aljunied station within 10mins walk or take bus number 2 (just in front of the vegetarian food center) to Bugis, Clarke Quay, Orchard and many other places

Our staying experience rate was 4.5 out of 5. Thank you for the host â­__"
"Just little problem with kitchen, because you cannot use it for cooking... over all it was fine."

Team was really helpful and supportive with early arrive and late leaving - with bag storage
"Emplacement au top car proche de petits restaurants pas chers. Ensuite, avec un grab, on est proche de tout pour pas cher.

Chambre trÃ¨s propre.
PropriÃ©taire trÃ¨s accueillant et arrangeant pour les heures d'arrivÃ©e.
Wifi dispo et performant!
Seul le fait que les toilettes et les douches et lavabos soient dans une seule et mÃªme piÃ¨ce est moins pratique car souvent occupÃ©s. 
Excellent rapport qualitÃ© prix!"
Cheap and great for amenities. Easy direction from host to get there.
Good place to stay when you want to visit Singapore. Clean. Quite place.

Good but not best.
"Very responsive, clean place"
"As a group of 5 we stayed at `Lindas`Airbnb for 2 Nights. 
Seems like everything is just put to a minimum..
As there are around 5 rooms for five different bookings (2-5 people per room) you only have 2 bathrooms to share, though one seemed to be out of order during the time we stayed there..
Also when we saw the big bottles of handwash they must put into both Shampoo and Bodywash in different colors.. I don't even have wooords.
Also just wasn't very clean and you could find bathrooms in the bathroom and Bedroom..
Wouldn't recommend If you can actually find something better, sorry"
Good space and nice host
"The Apartment was great and affordable
And clean even though the building a bit old, but still fine, near bus station and a lot of food around there
Had a great experience"
"Advantages: Good location - near MRT (around 5-10 minutes walking), clean toilet, room is big enough for 5 people. Linda is very responsive to answer all your inquiries. 
Disadvantage: only 2 bathrooms so it was a little bit unpleasant experience to stay when other travelers occupied toilets for a long time to make calls with their friends"
A bit inconvenient that there__ no private bathroom especially in the morning when everybody needs to have a shower before going out. The feel is not so homey. It is in an old building but elevator is working. Near to bus stations and MRT station. A good place if you want a cheap place to stay in Singapore.
"Preis- Leistung war ok, Lage gut erreichbar mit Ã¶ffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln, keine SitzplÃ¤tze im Zimmer oder der KÃ¼che, Bad  braucht dringend Renovierung"
"The place is a great location to stay in Singapore if you are a big group of travellers. It is just near the city about 10minutes by taxi. The place is not that far at the airport which is a good thing. There are many food hubs and hawkers nearby around the place. The whole unit looks clean and presentable. Overall, this is a great place to stay and a great price if you are just looking for an accommodation to rest/sleep after a whole day of exhausting city tour."
very nice!
"near aljunied mrt station, wifi is superfast! wow!"
Great hospitality and the place is very clean! Very near to Aljunied MRT and there's a number of local shops nearby for food. Convenient place to stay!
"We feel unsafe to stay in this property due to the owner check the room frequently. Once we leave, the owner will go in and check to make sure we switch off the aircon. This is how we get to know that owner is checking the room frequently, i received message from owner regarding of we did not switch off the air-con once we leave the room. We are just at downstair waiting for grab. There are many times when we going out and the owner is coming in to check for others rooms. 
Although stated there that the owner are allowed to enter the room to switch off air-con if we do not switch it off, i think is rather invading the privacy of our property in the room.
What if our valuable goes missing, who will take responsible? 
The house is quite pack, there are 5 rooms but with only 2 bathrooms and this is very inconvenient to us. Each rooms can actually occupied more than 5 peoples. Can you imagine if at one time everyone in the house wanted to use the bathroom, how inconvenient can it cause?
Rooms are not sound prove, we couldn't  get to sleep well for the whole night as the baby next door keep crying.

Afterall i still think that frequently checking of room is not appropriate."
Very accessible place and the host was very very helpful and nice. It was a great experience!!

"Die Kommunikation ist sehr gut, die Unterkunft ist sauber. Lage ist gut (GarkÃ¼chen, Supermarkt und MRT fu_lÃ¤ufig). Die RÃ¤ume sind aber sehr klein, vor allem wenn man viel GepÃ¤ck hat. Es gibt pro Doppelbett nur eine Decke. Es gibt 2 GemeinschaftsbÃ¤der fÃ¼r vier Zimmer (a 4 Personen) und eine GemeinschaftskÃ¼che ohne Herd. Keine SitzmÃ¶glichkeit (KlappstÃ¼hle aber kein Tisch)."
Highly recommend
"Good place to stay, clean, and comfy"
"Great place, comfortable beds, good location. The hallway is a little loud (doors opening and closing, people walking, people talking, people__ alarms in other rooms)."
"Affordable place in good location. Good access to train station and easy walk to Katong, Sports Hub and Old Airport Rd Food Center."
Ok good
Clean and tidy place. Great host.
"Reasonable price, strongly recommend!"
"Overall was quite okay. Since I only stayed for a night. And for such price I hope atleast I can get a towel. 
The host was friendly and fast response. I last minute booked the room and got it right away. Thank you."
The place is clean. Good for it__ cost and the host is accomodating. I recommend the place for travellers looking for a place to stay here in SG. 
The location was ideal with true facts.
"Raymond (Linda's husband) was very helpful and nice. The room was clean, located on the 7th floor. Our room was near the bathroom. They provided Shampoo and Shower Gel in the bathroom. The location was near the bus stop which was nice. Overall it was a very nice experience staying at Linda's place."
"A nice place to stay, very recommended! :)"
"kamar bersih,  sabun sampo tersedia, dekat pemberhentian bus,  nyaman tidak bising,  wlaupun agak jauh dari pusat keramaian tapi sangat menyenangkan."
"location was good near to MRT & food store , this apartment got 1 master room + 4 private room and share 2 bath room, no towel provided pls standby yourself , cooking was not allowed,  sound prove not so good as we were staying near toilet and night time still can hear next door talking.

over all still acceptable."
"The room is clean and nice.. Bath soap, Shampoo, hair dryer, hanger, toilet paper tissue are all provided.. It__ so nice staying here, but i was hoping the place is nearer the MRT station.. Thank you, host!!"
"Don't expect anything, It is what it is shown in the pictures...
Carry your own toiletries..."
I__ staying at Linda__ house for 3 nights and the room was great and spacious for 5 people. We stay there for our BTS concert and there are another guests staying there for the concert too. Please prepare your own towel.

Mostly all review is a good
not bad
"Linda's apartment is quite an old building, but well maintained. We have clean room, comfy bed, aircon & hot water. There is a little playground across the street with vegan restaurant. MRT station is 7 minutes walking distance."
"Linda is a very good host - very responsive, and also always looks after our needs.

The location is quiet and very accessible to Sentosa and Orchard. There are plenty of options for food nearby."
Please bring your own shampoos & body wash.
Good service
"We stayed in a hotel for 3 days before we checked-in, and i realised the difference immediately. The place is basically a house with interiors restructured to have 4 rooms and 2 bathrooms. So some of the rooms has boarded walls. The place is good if one is backpacking or even if you are a travelling adults, but is certainly not good for family stay. From price we payed, if we had payed SGD 50 more we could have had a much better accommodation in a hotel.
Here are the pros,
1) Washing Machine
2) Separate Kitchen Area

Here are the cons,
1) No Attached bathroom (you need to share bathrooms with other guests)
2) Bathtowels wont be provided.
3) Airconditioning cools the room very slowly.
4) Rooms will be cleaned when you checkout.
5) Extra blankets will be provided only at a price.
6) One could get a better accommodation in a hotel, if they pay a little bit more.
7) Bathrooms have the functionality but, ill-equipped. ie.. You could see the water faucet broken.
8) Boarded walls, you could be heard by other guests. Privacy could be an issue."
my first experience in sharing bath room
It's a good leisurely walk from the Aljunied MRT Station.  The place offered good value for money.
"The place is clean and very accessible to public transportation (i.e., MRT)"
Value for money 
"Had a great time staying at Linda__ place. Very clean, and extremely value for money. Highly recommended"
Value for money.

Great place with friendly hosts!
Everything good. Good place and value for money
Sometimes during morning expect long queue in the bathrooms
Good place to stay and the host is friendly.
"Room is new, clean relaxing.
Near mrt aljunied station
Walking distance to supermarket & food resto
Quiet & peaceful area
Fast Internet connection awesome!!!
Easy to get grab car w/reasonable fare
We didn't buy sg sim card surviving 4days exploring sg. "
The host sandy respond fast and helpful with any of our question. The house was easy access via bus or mrt with just a bit walking. Room are spacious and clean.
"This apartment is very clean.

Host was helpful and accommodating to my needs. The room was very clean.
"It was an awesome stay, really good location and friendly staffs _¤ï_ thanks a lot!! Best place for students! BTW! ITS ALL NEW!!"
"very comfortable place,with kitchen to use which is very convenient .And only 5 minutes walk to MRT station."
"This is a nice hostel with excellent location but keep in mind that the rooms are not even half as fancy or big as they look in pictures. The kitchen is quite a bit messy most of the times. You have to carry your own sheets, pillows, utensils etc.  
By Singapore standards, it is still a good value for money. Just consider this a student hostel (more apt for undergrad) and not your standard Airbnb."
Location is the key!
With refer to others and choose in next trip if vacant for my travel schedule

Recommended to everyone ! Strategic location. Clean. Delicious breakfast.
a gem in the heart of the city.
Very good location and it feels quite private even though staying so close to other guests. I liked that you have to take off your shoes before entering the room - makes it very clean. And that it was very quiet so you can get a proper rest no matter the hour.
Lovely stay in a great location!
Pretty nice hostel to stay in.
"Great location, great value"
Very cute place to stay. Very friendly and helpful personal. Very good location. Definitely recommended.
This place is great. They really capture Singapore's high tech living into this place. I enjoyed every bit of my stay. Check-In was great.

My stay was very comfortable as the hosts are very kind and unobtrusive.
"I had a great stay here! The hosts were very welcoming, and kind. They let me do my own thing, and also told me about the neighborhood when I arrived.

"Huang__ place is very nice, clean, and quiet. It looks exactly like the pictures presented. Great pool view in both bedrooms. Huang is also fast at responding to our needs."
The hosts at this property were amazing and went above and beyond to assist where needed and had excellent communication.  Great property for a family with amazing swimming pool and kids water play area. The convenience store located in the complex was great. The property itself was clean and tidy and modern. We would highly recommend this host and property.
"Great place for small families. The rooms all have nice pool views. I was driving a rental and the parking was free but you have to register with true security at the guardhouse. 

Will definitely return to stay if possible."
Very cozy and clean. Thank god for being able to smoke at the balcony

"I brought my family (parents and children) to Singapore and stayed at Amy's place. Very comfy and stylish, The pool area are so big and the childrens pool is very nice for kids to play there. And theres a playground area so iys a very nice place to brong children. The place is a little far from stations if you want to travel by mrt. But we travel by online taxi so its not a big deal for us."
Squeaky clean. Easy check-in. Great amenities. Responsive host.

"Amy's place is a nice base for us since we're visiting relatives who live in the same district. 

For those who are looking to travel further afield, a couple of MRT Stations are a bus ride away (with bus stops pretty much outside/opposite the condo).

In addition to a small on-site convenient store, there are a small 24-hour local supermarket, a small local non-air conditioned food court and a petrol station nearby. However, it requires a trip on the bus to get to the closest shopping centre & proper supermarket.

The unit itself is cosy and adequate for 4 adults. There were some problems with the internet and TV service when we checked in, which were resolved within 24 hours.

Since the dining option in the immediate vicinity is limited, we planned (& did) have breakfast in the unit everyday. There were a few pots & pans (plus a toaster and a rice cooker) but no utensils to cook with. There were also no cooking knife beside a small paring knife and no dining knife except for a couple of plastic knives for kids. That made cooking and eating breakfast a bit of a challenge. Luckily we were able to borrow some from our relatives but it would have been incredibly annoying if we had to buy such items while we're on holiday.

While we're not traveling with any kids, I can see that parents traveling with kids would appreciate the kids cutlery and diningware, and the small toy collection available in the unit.

The pools are also child friendly. The main pool is deep enough for adults to swim in but shallow enough for older kids to stand up in. There are also plenty of shallow area in the main pool and a whole separate pool for the little ones."
"Nice place, excellent host."
"My family of 5 (3 children) all enjoyed staying here. Pool fantastic. Shop downstairs very friendly and good food. TV great. Nice balcony area. Quiet. Great views of pool. Kitchen and bathrooms clean and well equipped. Walking distance to bus, supermarket and hawker food court."
Cosy place with ample space. Host was also responsive
"Lovely clean accommodation,  practical amenities provided (microwave, gas stove, washer/dryer, large fridge) and 2 lovely swimming pools on-site.  Easy access to public transport."

"Amy__ place turned out better than expected. Great to stay at an Airbnb with personal touches and fresh linen. My child loved the amazing pools & playground and the little shop ( sells handy selection of hot noodles and rice)  downstairs very useful. A little bit of walk to small strip of hawker Centre and larger block of shops & MRT. But bus stop outside condo will take you anywhere, including MRT and Tampines shopping mall for $1.50. Highly recommend the bus service from this accom."
"This is a very good place for 3-4 people. The property is very nicely maintained and has all the essentials. The location is very convenient, with all the top attractions at a 30-45 minutes distance by MRT.  Hannah is very good at communication and her responses were very prompt and detailed. Overall, we had a very good experience."
"Good location, 15mins to airport and 15mins to East Coast Park/Seafood Centre, 20mins to cbd and Sentosa with car.  A big plus with free parking and super big swimming pool, good for family."
Thank you for a wonderful stay. Lovely home in great complex. My family enjoyed it. Beautiful pools!
"Had a wonderful time, just like the photos  it was spacious. The pool is perfect to relax"
"Pros: Very cute and modern rental with very cold air conditioning, beds were cozy, well equipped kitchen, quality shampoo and conditioner in both bathrooms, great tea selection, rental was clean and had a few toys for toddlers.  
Cons: The biggest issue with this rental is that the host wants you to keep the fact that you are renting an airbnb a secret.  We were advised not to even tell our taxi driver that it was an airbnb.  We were told to tell the security gate agent and neighbors that we were visiting family. We booked this rental 7 months prior to arrival but did not learn of this secrecy until 3 days before check in.  I feel compelled to include this as a lot of people may want to know this prior to booking.  Some people don__ feel comfortable being dishonest and I think they should know prior to booking that this is expected."
"Great condo to stay with huge pool. Located at convenient place nearby airport, easy access to anywhere in the island."
"This was a nice apartment which felt very secure and safe, the pool and surrounding areas were all very well kept and spotless .  This apartment is far from everything but the airport... do your homework before you arrive for transport and shops and cafes."
"The host is a good communicator and thanks her for giving flexibility in check in/out. She__ responsive. It was positive in terms of communication. 

The space is good enough for 2 people and I like the view and balcony.  

The public transport nearby was okay. It was not near the downtown to be honest and it usually took 40/50mins for commuting, but transportation costs were responsible. Compare with living in downtown with higher accommodation costs, I felt okay living here. 

The cons of this accommodation are the structure design or building fabric. I can hear people slamming doors or walking fast upstairs. I didn__ have good sleep to be honest and the problem was serious especially in morning as people were rushing for work or date. If you plan to go out in morning, I think it will not be a problem. 

But I think it__ the common problem of houses here in Singapore. My friend who lives in Singapore for years and has bought a flat / rented a flat before has got the same issues as well."
It is a full house in the maner of both equipment and happiness. My family had a really sweet experience during the time staying here.  Highly recommend for family with young kids.
"The unit is well equipped with Traveller comfort in mind. Generous with bathroom supplies, paper towels & travel sized toiletries are a nice touch. A few tea bags in the kitchen. The space is clean except for the wood rot around one of the bathroom door frames that the host has known about for some time. Would be rated higher if this was fixed."
"This place is better than advertised. Simply put, the it is amazing. Wish we could have stayed longer!"
"The apartment is in a condominium so you can expect top notch amenities. While we were there, we used the pool the most, it was nice and big. 

The apartment is comfortable enough to house 4-6 adults, we even manage to cook a little when we were there. 

It is clean and the beds are comfy. The best thing is, we are able to see the pool from all the rooms.

We definitely stay again. _ºï_"
"Lovely apartment. Very clean and with stunning pool facilities - possibly the biggest pool I have ever seen and great kids area too.

As other reviews have said, the apartment is quite far from the city but public transport links are good and easy (use CityMapper app for public transport or Grab for booking a taxi).

The issue for us was the owners lack of communication. We were told to use the main buzzer for the building and although the owner was overseas, she would still be able to let us in. We buzzed and got no response so then had to wait until someone else came in and 'tailgate' them which wasn't ideal.

Once in, the apartment was very clean and comfortable but we had only been provided with 3 towels, despite saying from the outset that there were 4 in our group. Messaged the owner to ask where we could get another towel from and frustratingly never received a response.

In short, lovely apartment but expensive given the location and lack of comms."

"the ply is very clean and the view is stunning, we feel homey in amy's condo, for the transportation is not hard to find, outside the condo you will meet buss station , and you can take bus number 23 or 518 and stop in the very next station which is bugis north MRT, overall we very recommend amy's condo to all travellers"
Great stay with clean environment! Was very satisfied with the view from the apartment.
We had a good stayed. Nice place and nice host. Will be stay again

Amazing staycation
"Amy's place was fantastic! The touches for families and kids were amazing. There were books and small toys available and the available amenities such as the pool, gym, convenience made it a great stay. 

Only downside was closeby tourist attraction. You're not staying in the city. However, not too far as all of Singapore when need to catch a grab! 

Thank you Amy for the great stay! Highly recommend her place for anyone staying as a small family or couple!"

Nice place for staycation and nearby many useful and great amenities.
"A place with great swimming pool view. 
Stylish designed apartment.
Comfortable and relaxing time for me."
"Safety while staying here will be a concern. 
The owner__ maid and Property Agent entered the home, without ringing the door bell, without knocking, but merely unlocking the main door and entering while we were staying inside. We were utterly stunned. 
Normally the home owners update us exactly when they are coming by (I was informed The Maid was coming the next day as the kettle was a fire hazard and nearly imploded when we used it) and we open the door, as you need to be respectful for people__ safety and security when they book your Homes, but here nope. They just blaze right in. Literally we walked out to the living room and got shocked there was a random lady and then an hour later a random guy appeared. We were all in our home clothes, not in outfits strangers should see. 
And the answer from the owner is constantly just a sorry. 
Completely sans any genuine concern. 
I have stayed in Airbnb all around the world and this is honestly my worst experience. I have visual proof and print screen of conversations with the host and place. 
Seriously terrible experience."
"I stayed here for two months. Great place. Has a kitchen with a stove, toaster oven, microwave. Study area is great. Palani, the staff member on-site, is fantastically helpful in all things. Recommended."
good
"Darrick was kind enough to arrange our check-in even if it was at 2:30 AM from the airport. Moreover, he went the extra mile by letting us leave our luggage on check-out day until midnight. Would definitely recommend staying with him!"
Recommended for family or group stay. Good location and walking distance to shopping area-Orchard Road and many good eateries nearby. One thing for sure is that the Host-Rc will make sure you all have a good and comfortable stay at his place! Thanks Rc!
The place is convenient and the host is understanding and accomodating. We had a great stay.
ê°ê²©ë_ë¹ ê´_°®_µë__
The apartment is exactly like in the pictures. The host wasn't there and we checked in with the help of one of the workers through the intercom. The apartment was modern and was family friendly.
"Very clean and modern place. Surprised by his place. Accommodated us with filtered hot and cold water to have during our stay in the building.  It was just right for us. It__ located near many shops, restaurants, convenience store and transportation.

RC and his staff communicated well and helped right away when we had AC issues. Would stay there again. Thanks."

"Great host! Very kind, always response quickly! The house is very nice, near a very big local food court, highly recommended to go there. There is also next to the house bus that can take you to the MRT. At the building you can find a nice pool and a gym. Thank you Ang!"
"Hello readers, I stayed in Ang's place about 2.5 weeks. We were 2 adults, we used both sleeping rooms separately. Here's my review: ***getting there from airport*** rather easy... take east-west subway (MRT) until lavender, then bus 145 heading to ballestier road, then walk 5min. Cool was that I met my host in person! But don't miss last bus, runs about midnight! Walk from nearest nightbus-stop is 30min. ***Area*** Safe, near a main road, so rather noisy, even at 9th floor and during the night. Sound insulation from windows don't exists at that place. There is many restaurants but most close at 10pm, I suggest you place any order by 9pm. Public food market booths next door. 24h supermarket within 10min walk. Mostly residential area, no bars to go to. A bit far from center. Takes about 45 min by bus to harbourfront (towards sentosa) and about 25min to orchard road. Walking to the nearest subway is 15min. (Note: the is no map of busroutes anywhere. Must use (Hidden by Airbnb) maps for that! No digitals screens on busses!) ***The Flat*** less posh than what the professionally made up pictures suggest, it is more of the ""standard place"". Clean and rather good. Partially could use a bit of painting refresh. Small kitchen... just ok enough to make a breakfast. For bigger meals, I suggest go restaurant instead. Big bedroom can host 2 adults. Small bedroom, I suggest one teenager only. TV... no channels, bring your own netflix credentials. Internet is great, good wifi in all the place. Air conditioner is great as well. Bathroom is fair enough. Pool is below my own expectations. ***Hosts*** very kind couple, I can recommend. Ask questions via (Hidden by Airbnb) if needed. ***last words*** a bit pricy, but due to the 2 bedrooms, it turn out Ok. Good service by hosts, but sadly you need busses to go anywhere worthwhile a visit. Would I book this place again? Hmmm... I have mixed feelings due to its location, I would try to find something closer to the center, or at least right near a subway station... but under same circumstances (2 bedroom requirement) perhaps I would book it again, yes... because the place itself is not bad, which of course you also can expect at the charged rate. Don't expect to much though... the professional picture guy did a real good job."
"It was delivered clean, central for food and  medical facilities, wet market and buses/MRT. Quiet and private also. 

The owner is friendly and kindly allowed me to stay well beyond check (noon) time due to late flight out."
"Beds were SO comfy! Rooms nice and dark due to the curtains, and sunny when you open them, just like the pictures. Air conditioning was good.

As others have said, a bit noisy from the street on weekdays, but nothing the fan won__ quell. Weekend was perfectly quiet.

Pool was lovely, and we had it all to ourselves.

Food market next door had gorgeous looking produce and fish as well as land animals. We didn__ realize it was there at first. Would have been a great source for a BBQ. (Yes, there__ a poolside grill and picnic table) Pack a few condiments and seasonings tho.

There__ also a devilishly good bakery at the end of the street. Follow the intoxicating scent. Open 24 hours. It ain__ a Starbucks, and that__ a good thing.

Superlative hawker market next door as well! Morning coffee was local-luscious, and food AMAZING! Locals only, so a super plus. Anthony Bourdain woulda been proud. I miss him so 

Easy access to buses (def get the EZ Pass at the airport- we spent $17 pp USD to go all over Sing__ for a week on bus and train + $5 for the card itself which we paid forward at the airport when we left)

Overall, basic, but good value.  Great for a couple of couples or a family on a budget. Bring your own seasonings, toiletries (there__ shampoo, not conditioner; Kleenex but not napkins), and an open mind.

We had a few hiccups surging our stay, and Ang was very responsive."

Good apartment with a nice pool. About 3 minutes from a 24 hour hawker area which provided delicious food. Ang was very helpful.
"Our trip to Singapore in May2019 was to celebrate a wedding anniversary and a birthday.   We booked a 2 bedroom condo for 7 nights hosted by Ang and we were not disappointed.

Location.
At first felt we were way out of everything but the next day, it all became clear.  Taxis to/from Changi Airport approx. S$54.00 so a far way to accommodation.  Transport from accommodation, leave via swimming pool gate, turn right then right again, a bus stop. Just remember Balestier Road as your bus base for transport to MRT.  Buy a transport pass at airport for approx. S$20.00 and we travelled all over Singapore, got lost, hopped on another bus or MRT and came home to Australia with a credit of S$5.90 left each on card (valid 5 years).
At end of Close, a bread bakery, green roof building a food hall and little building with yellow stripes, a 24 hour supermarket.

Accommodation.
Comfortable for 2 people.  We used 2nd bedroom as a dressing room - clothes/suitcases etc.  Bedrooms furniture a little large making areas smaller.  Basic cooking but who cooks more than a snack in Singapore.  Ang - you need a new flat bottom frypan.  Large TV with Netflix, washing machine with powder and softener supplied (so handy),  free WIFI, aircons work a treat, small balcony off bedroom and a large open room (drying clothes) and coffee in morning watching the area come alive.  Excellent security with code for condo door and cards for entry into site.  2 lifts in building for accommodation on 9th floor.

Hostess.
Waited for arrival at night, explained all to us and available should we need help during our stay.

Would we stay again?
Yes.   A lovely hostess, a perfect condo for us (both in our 70s), good location, transport  easy, quiet building, road noise but close doors -  it is a moving and live area.  Watch the world pass by your condo.
Thanks Ang."
"Le sÃ©jour dans l'appartement de Ang Ã©tait trÃ¨s confortable et avec la piscine, vraiment trÃ¨s agrÃ©able, Ang est trÃ¨s accueillante et nous as montrÃ© oÃ¹ acheter _ manger et _ boire aux environs.

Nice location with a hawker centre close-by. Supermarket is also within walking distance. There is also a traditional bakery in the same street.
This place was very convenient and easy to get around.  The Hawker market was only a few steps away.  The picture of the place was definitely was much nicer as previous reviewer mentioned.  Ang was very responsive to questions before and during our stay.  Having Netflix was nice since it was so hot to go sight seeing during the day.  We enjoyed our stay!
"Ang's place is well situated for easy access to the bus routes and a quick bus ride to the Novena MRT, The local Fair Price supermarket is just a short walk through the local Hawker markets.  The supermarket is extremely well stocked with every type of product you could want. We loved Ang's apartment . The second bedroom was ideal for our teenager . The aircon throughout works very well and were very satisfied with the other amenities including a strong wifi. Ang greeted us on arrival and showed us how everything worked. Very happy."
Wonderful!
A great condo and awesome host. This place is beautiful. There is a food court and 24 hour restaurant within walking distance. We arrived at 1:30am in the morning and Ms. Ang__ associate Ms. Grace was waiting for us. Thank you both so much. We had a great time.

"This was a really great stay. But there__ some downsides experienced from the stay. 

The house was a bit narrow, a little discomfort but it__ still ok for me; the pool too, is small but it__ ok for a short dip. Also, the stay__ kinda far away from the MRT station, so most of the time we used GRAB to go around places, it__ more simple and convenient.

But these downsides are almost negligible. I love how the hosts greet us and communicate with us, very friendly and likable. The stay is also near to the 24-hour supermarket, therefore it__ convenient to get some things to eat and drink whenever we feel like it. The main reason we choose this stay for our vacation is because of the value, it__ the best value we could get out of most of the stays in Singapore.

Thank you very much."

Great place! Everything was easy and great! I hope I can stay here again
"The hosts are lovely welcoming people. Excellent communication! The apartment is compact but comfortable ... bus services are easily available right next to the apartment, although the nearest MRT stations are 20 minutes walk away. It's good value for money - recommended!"
Amazing view would really recommend to stay here. Very friendly host!
Very nice host. Cute place. Not the great location if you want to enjoy bars and restaurants. Not enough towels. Beds were comfy.

Easy check in (communication via (Hidden by Airbnb) ), clean apartment and good surface, good enough for our family with 2 kids.

"This stay was convenient for us. It__ not so accessible to public transport but since i was with my parents, we were taking Grab all the time which wasn__ a problem. We can wait from the 9th floor and we can the Grab car approaching. Only then would be go down. No wasted time.

The place is spacious, and comfortable. The water is strong, with heater even in the kitchen sink. Putting a bidet in the toilet would be an added value (just a suggestion).

There are plenty of cleaning materials to use, with spare quick fix what-nots inside e drawers and store room, including medicine (very generous and thoughtful) which can come handy for those just-in-case moments.

The view is nice on all sides. I love the sound of birds chirping/singing in the morning. In Singapore. Wow!! The sun rise is a sight to behold while sipping coffee in the veranda.

The 24 hrs grocery is a big plus point. The huge hawker place, too. All walking distance.

Ms Ang is a nice lady. She welcomed us upon arrival and did a quick tour."
"Absolutely highly recommended for anyone. Everything was great. The place,  the service and the communication. For sure will stay if coming back to Singapore. Miss Ang and Ms. Priya are really good host. 
Thank you both for making my family stay easier than anticipated."
Very convenient location
Miss Ang is a wonderful host. She made sure that she is there  when we arrive. Excellent communication. Her loft is very spacious. I like the fact that there is a near by 24 hr food court. I will highly recommend Miss Ang's home.
"We highly recommend this place. It is a two minute walk to a large hawker center, grocery, and other shops and restaurants. Communication was quick and warm. The space was spotless, everything works well. It's so nice we already rebooked for another stay. Also a great value!"
"Spacious and clean. Pictures are accurate and true, she's also provide those basic necessities hence, it was convenient."
Nice place!
"Place was well-furnished and facilities were good! Host was responsive and helpful during my stay, however, better communication would make the experience better.

Had to pay extra to use both bedrooms within the apartment as I booked for 2 pax & I was told that only 1 bedroom was provided if booking was only for 2 pax. (Booking stated that price was for entire apartment)"
Very good location with many areas of interest nearby. Mrs Ang is a very nice host too

"The place is centrally located and the photos are true to description. If you are a foodie, Whampoa Hawker Center is right next door with plenty of food options."

"Old building, central location, small room and not an apartment. Basic facilities , clean  and cheap."
"The apartment was clean and in a great location - supermarket down the road and only 10 min walk to the nearest MRT. Check in was easy and communication was good. There were (Hidden by Airbnb) details for contact on the back of the door and we got a reply instantly. It was very small, however that seems to be the way with Airbnb at this budget in Singapore. Only problems we had were a drainy smell from the shower, no washing powder and the lack of windows (none). Absolutely fine for a few nights in Singapore for 1 or 2 people, far too confined for a long stay."
Nice Airbnb that was close to public transport services and in walking distance of orchard road shopping district
"This was a last minute booking as our reservation was cancelled by another host on the day before our travel. It was a hassle to find new host on such short notice, but glad that we found Mr. Ong__ accommodation, it went well in the end. We were pleasantly surprise with our space, a clean room with windows and a door leading to a small balcony. The mattress provided for the 3rd guest was a full bed, comfy too. Our room was inside a big, renovated house few blocks away from the main operation building. It is at a quiet street and we enjoyed the noise free environment, except for the 1st night when the guest above shifted some furniture. The elevator stops right in front of our door, we like to think of it as our private lift. The bus stop across the main road is very convenient as the buses take you to many places. You do need to walk a bit to get to the nearest Sommerset MRT though, unless you take a bus to Fort Canning MRT.  When we checkout, we just hail a taxi by the roadside to get to the airport.

We made full use of the washer/dryer to have fresh laundry everyday. You do need to get your own detergent. Use the mini fridge to store fruits bought from Fair Price Supermarket which is about 70m away. If you walk further away along Killiney Road, you will find many small eateries. The Teochew Porridge place is a small food center and if your day starts early morning, this would serve you Asean breakfast. 

Internet speed was very good. Other from wifi, you can watch youtube from the TV because only a few local channels available.   
Just a few cons :
1. No plastic for garbage bin. We reuse Fair Price__ plastic bags. We do not mind disposing our own garbage, but the doorman told us to leave it at our doorstep. 
2. Many storage cabinets but lacking of a place to hang our clothes."
This Appartment is ok for one night. We had a room next to a common room so there you hear talking from 6 am on. The air in the Apartment isnt good.
"Small place, perfect for a one man traveller. The bathroom is also very tiny, we had to brush our teeth in the kitchen and water would flood throughout the bathroom floor. Other than that, all the relevant necessities were there."
Clean and fuss free check in

Location is central..
Good decent place and easily accessible.
An alternative budget place to stay in orchard area but definitely not fancy. Just enough to get you rested and shower.
"Location is very nice! Place does not look exactly like in picture, kind of misleading. Owner use same photos for several different units"
"it__ a good place to stay, but u might want to consider the room
Cause some room is too small"
Very nice journey!
"More a hotel like building than a home or an apartment but that__ ok! Place is as expected and does the job. In a good location as well. Note that our room didn__ have any windows, just an fyi!"
"We found the place worth of the location as it is not far from downtown and Fort Canning MRT Station is walking distance and we can also get busses from the front of the house. Quiet surrounding.

Restaurants are many around the area."
Ok thanks for the stay
"It's a bit far from the Fort Canning MRT station, but bus services are good enough"
"value for money
cozy place but no windows.
better take a bus to fort canning st than walking to somerset st"

The place is about 1km from somerset MRT & plaza singapura. There is no direct bus to Somerset & Plaza Singapura. But there is a direct bus to Orchard ( Bus 54 ). It alights infront of DFS. I stayed at the new building. I think it's the only room that available and there are other rooms which are under renovation. So my room was quite affected as the dust were everywhere. Thanks to Lee for her quick response. She offered to clean my room every 2 days. Pls note that some of the rooms are not lift landed! It'd be very troublesome if you have big baggages with you.
"The room itself is pretty spot on. What I did not expect was the room to be situated in front of the laundry and kitchen area. But if you just need a place to sleep and go, then this place suites you."
"Location near bus stop but quite far from the mrt, about 10-15 min walk"

"Nice and clean place to stay. The family are lovely and nice. Xiao is quick to respond and happy to offer any help. BTW, it__ very convenient if you want to go NTU."
Very nice family. Rooms are big and the hosts are warmhearted. Good location for accessing NTU.
Very good.
"Good place. Much confort. 
Ps: When you arrive, better knock at the door, rather than using the bell."
"I stayed here for about 10 days as I was moving into the country and needed somewhere to stay short term before moving into my own place. I chose it due to the proximity to NTU and was very pleased with the location. It's very convenient to take a bus to either NTU directly (after a short walk) or straight to Jurong Point (the stop is almost directly in front of the building). The room itself is comfortable, very clean, and with good A/C. Angelika and Ray were very helpful and friendly, giving me tips and advice about the area and where to find the best food. I enjoyed the time I stayed with them, and would definitely stay again."
Excellent accommodation close to MRT and NTU. All basic amenities provided by the host.

"We appreciate this very beautiful and warm place Mr Lee and Mrs Lee offer us. These days it did make us feel like home and probably even more. We are very grateful for Mrs Lee's kind help. She is very warm-hearted and has taken us to the mall and NTU every day by car. To those new travelers to Singapore especially NTU, I have to say this is the very perfect place to choose. You will fall in love with everything."
This is a really lovely place to stay and run by a lovely couple. It is a short walk from the MRT system and accessible to basically the entire city.
"Mr.Lee and Mrs. Lee was an amazing host. The room was spacious. Clean. Mrs.Lee was very kind to drop me off everyday to NTU. I will definitely come back here again. Anyways, thank you for everything you did for me throughout my entire stay."
"Staying at Mr & Mrs. Lee place felt like coming to close friend or relatives house.
Mr. Lee picked us at the station and even drove us to the conference where we supposed to attend. Mr & Mrs. Lee always ensured us to have everything we need to get a comfortable stay. Mrs. Lee took me to the mall, and she even extended her kindness to drive us to the Changi Airport which is quite far from her place. This is our first experience with Airbnb, and surely our first experience is very satisfactory thanks to the kindness shown by Mr & Mrs. Lee."
"My scientific collaborators from Thailand stayed with Mr and Mrs Lee for two nights. They were just super hosts, driving my guests to NTU and also downtown. The place is clean and rooms big. It is very close to NTU."
"Hospitable, helpful, resourceful, sociable and welcoming."
this place is out of this world. who would expect this kind of amazing place on airbnb.

Very recommended place 
"Highly recommended to everyone. Large room with airconditioner, clean and quiet. Mr. & Mrs. Lee are very kindhearted, they drove me to NTU on time every morning. Thanks very much! Hoping to visit again!"
Lee and his wife was very friendly and so supportive. We had an enjoyable stay there and would recommend the place for any one who appreciate the whiteness in neighbourhood.

 The hostess of the room was very kind and amiable. We felt the warmth of home. Thank you very much for accompanying us around Nanyang Polytechnic University. I miss you very much, warm smile, I hope to check in again next time."
A landed property. Not a typical house in Singapore. Clean and modern. The host offered rides to NTU and the airport out of kindness. Super super host.

Excellent hospitality, Mrs Lee the host is very nice and offered to fetch us to the mall and the university. There is another room next to the one we were staying and it is separated by a glass partition. Sometimes you may hear the other people in the room talk but overall we were able to sleep well.

"Red Doorz at Geylang is one of the best places I stayed in Singapore, location is easily accesible lots of hawkers nearby, friendly front staff and very clean, tidy place.... Will stay again"
Cheap place to crash
"I arrived after midnight when there was no reception and I didn't know which room to go. We had to call them and finally got a bed at 2 pm then I was moved to another room the next day. Though the place is close to the main sights, so the location is fine"
I recommend RedDoorz for backpackers! 
Clean and comfortable.
Worth the price.
great place for some not for all.
Nice place to stay. It is a well priced hostel.
"Die Lage des Unterkunft hat uns ganz gut gefallen. Die Ausstattung war auch in Ordnung. GestÃ¶rt hat uns das gro_e, leuchtende exitschild im Schlafzimmer, was sich genau neben meinem Hochbett befand und die Klimaanlage, die wir nicht verstellen konnten. Jedoch war es in gro_en und ganzen eine nette Unterkunft."
"Perfect stay , great location, great host !!!"
Great place to sleep and rest for the tiring day
"I made a booking at this place and the host confirmed my requests. I reached the place and suddenly the host said the place is fully booked. They moved me to another place hosted by them, and the place is so bad. Smelly, not tidy, and not looks like a normal hostel."
Our first mixed dorm is terrible. We 6 girls stay with 4 Indian/Bangladesh guy and hence we don__ even dare to go back earlier. But the location was quite convenient within 5 mins walk from MRT Kallang station
Good place
Good value for money.
It's a pretty ok place to stay at. It's close to MRT as well as most of the usual tourist attractions. The rooms are clean. Breakfast is bare and can get boring after a few days.

"Jing is a nice host, she is communicative and willing to explain any detail question I asked. Her place is amazing!"
Jing was a terrific host. Overall great communication and thoughtfulness. The unit was clean and exactly as advertised. Great location with lots of options for food and shopping within an easy walk.
"Jing is super kind she never had made me wait when I texted her 
The room was really nice as MBS is !"
I was so happy. The host gave me a quick response. The guest room is clean and has a good view.
best ever place that i stat
King was a great host and helped get me into the room quickly and at my schedule. The resort is amazing and iconic! Highly recommend!
Amazing apartment and location.  Jing was a wonderful host and very quick with responses. The apartment was in a great location and very clean & stylish.
"great experience, great host. thank you!"
Great to stay 1 night!
This place was exactly as advertised!  100% recommend and will rebook if I__ in the area again!  Infinity pool is totally worth the price alone!
Awesome place and Jing support was timely and accurate. Recommend to all
Awesome room in maybe the best hotel in the world...
Amazing accommodations would definitely stay here again. Nothing to want for. Everything is right in the area

"Wonderful place for the family. The pool is amazing. Room was spacious and Jing was responsive so communication was seemless. Amazing, wife and kids loved it. Will definitely return again for more fun weekends!"
"A great host, super friendly and quick in response. Wonderful place for the family,. it was really clean, spacious and  and has a nice view. Great place to stay for holiday or weekend staycation !!"
"Jing is great host, highly recomment to all, we will book again"
"Under normal circumstances, the hotel stay would have been great. However, with the COVID-19 safety measures, the hotel stay was unpleasant. Guests of the hotel needed to queue to get into elevators of the hotel (limited to only 4 people per lift), guest who wanted to use the infinity swimming pool needed to make reservations in advance thru the hotel's buggy reservation system. 5/5 i would recommend this hotel; only when the COVID-19 safety measures have been lifted."
"Perfect host, fuss free communication and very helpful. Thank you Jing!!!"
"Appartements propres et bien Ã©quipÃ©s, _ proximitÃ© des transports en commun.
Bonne rÃ©activitÃ©, communication facile."
"There was a last minute changes due to some technical issues with original place that I booked, but it wasn't a big deal. Other than location, everything pretty much the same. House is clean enough, beds are comfortable, all the cleaning supplies are also provided. Check in and out was very quick and easy."
"Really good location, large balcony on top, secured area."
Was lucky cause normally condo is always book. Fast n efficient respond from host. Easy check in. Will recommend host to my friends.
"Aaron and his team were very responsive to my inquiries. However, they will only contact you 1-2 days before your check-in date for the check-in instructions. I__ a worrier so not hearing from them immediately made me a little concerned.

The team will welcome you from the lobby/ parking and will even help you bring your things up! Points for Extra mile!

The place was great and was value for money indeed. However, I noticed dust on the leather headboard of the bed at the master__ bedroom on the second floor.

Also, the place is close to major highway so you might hear cars passing by most of the time. But, you__l get used to it immediately. 

Basic cutleries and cooking pans were provided so you don__ have to worry about any utensils. 

Overall, the place and the experience was great. 

Thank you Aaron and Team!"
"A centrally located and clean place to stay in the heart of Singapore. I felt very safe, with my own keys to the hostel and to my room and closet!"

"Quiet, convenient and cosy place for single travellers. Recommended!"
"I have been really pleased with Assemblage. It provided just what I needed. It is in a very good location with lots of excellent facilities in the neighbourhood. I wanted tranquility and found it.

"Assemblage is the perfect place to stay for a student on a budget. It has all the basic amenities that would be required for a stress free stay. It's only around a 25 mins drive from the Changi airport - get Grab (costs roughly 20 dollars vs taxi from the airport which would cost ~30 dollars). It is located directly opposite the Holland Village MRT station, which well connected to the rest of Singapore and just 2 stops away from Kent Ridge, NUS. Furthermore, there is 7- Eleven close by and a Cold Storage, where you can get your groceries. Holland Village itself is quite a lovely spot and very lively during the evenings, with an abundance of restaurants, shops, and there's also a decent food center (no halal food in this particular food center, but there are decent halal options around). The area is quite popular for expats, and the actual accommodation itself is quite quiet, safe and peaceful.  Zul was one of the staff members that was very helpful. Very worth the price and a stress free stay. Would highly recommend ! Thank you 3000 :)"
As advertised. Great and accommodating host! Will book the place again!
Very convenient place in Orchard. The owners are Very helpful anytime.
"Nice location, good cost performances."

"I stayed for a few nights in a female dorm. My experience was great, particularly due to the amazing staff hospitality! The location is superb in terms of access to public transit, tourist attractions, places to eat, etc. Communication with the host was always very good and efficient!

I was quite happy to have restful nights: the capsules are well equiped, the beds are very comfortable, the room was quiet and everything is designed to make your stay as convenient as possible.

Overall, the place is clean (there's room for improvement when it comes to the washrooms though) and very stylish. It's the perfect place for the minimalist traveller, not so much for those with large and/or heavy luggage, as there is no elevator in the property.

I definitely recommend it!"
Amazing place for a short stay. Totally worth every penny. Highly recommended

"Great stay for a couple of days, as it__ located right in Chinatown. Walking distance everywhere and public transportation right behind the corner if needed. 

I was looking for a __etter kind of_ hostel or alternatively traditional Airbnb room for myself in Singapore, as I was traveling alone simply in a need of good recommendations and advices. For leisure purpose, I would definitely recommend CUBE. 

The owner whose name I cannot remember unfortunately went beyond limits to make the guests feel like home. Big thanks to her for that! 
Also the staff in general made an impression. Especially Terry from the Philippines and the guy who was in charge of the bar/reception for a while by himself (on Saturday evening) still remaining super cool under the pressure."
"This is a good value spot if you're comfortable interacting and sharing spaces with other guests. It really is an upscale / premium-hostel that is good for the money. The service is great and staff are very friendly + a cool place to hang out inside with free breakfast, wifi, and morning coffee. The only issue I had with this place is that they brand themselves as a hotel, when in reality it is a premium-hostel. Some other guests were noisy in the shared rooms after 9pm when I wanted to rest and it had me missing some of the more private aspects of a quiet hotel in that regards."
"Exceptionally comfortable and friendly stay, thank you!!!"
centrally located good place at fair rental charges.
"The place is great, location couldn__ be better, and the staff very kind and professional. I highly recommend this place. I had a great stay!"

Absolutely great place that is close to so many great things on Singapore! Bonus is that the beds are super comfortable!
Clean and comfortable and they staff are lovely.

"Je suis restÃ© une semaine dans ce logement, sans problÃ¨me.

Ayant dÃ©j_ testÃ© ce concept prÃ©cÃ©demment, celui-ci peut Ãªtre classifiÃ© de confortable. 

La literie est de bonne qualitÃ©, le nombre de salle de bain permet de ne pas avoir _ attendre (toujours trouvÃ© une de disponible), le petit dÃ©jeunÃ© du matin, bien que rÃ©pÃ©titif est suffisant. 

Niveau propretÃ©, malgrÃ© l'aspect communautaire, c'est correct et nettoyÃ© rÃ©guliÃ¨rement. Si une salle de bain parait un peu sale, il suffit d'en choisir une autre.

L'emplacement est trÃ¨s bien situÃ©. Proche des transports et mÃªme suffisamment central pour pouvoir s'en passer.

Le staff est disponible et vraiment sympathique.

Je recommande et reviendrais sans problÃ¨me !"

"I was surprised how comfortable it is. Even for the me, who are not staying in hostels normally, the experience was just great! You feel very private, the showers are basically turn to your personal bathrooms when you lock the door, and there are plenty over there. Location is just superb! Highly recommend for a lonely travellers."
"Amazing hostel stay. It was comfortable and clean. If you are a solo traveler, this is a luxury pick for sure. Bathrooms, beds and all storage were amazing. I'll be staying here again."
"I enjoyed my stay very much. It was clean, comfortable and everyone on staff was very helpful."
Great location! Clean and stylish. Definitely worth a visit.
"Sleep was comfortable despite sleeping in a tight space - i was skeptical at first, but it made me change my mind about staying in a hostel, and in a cube/capsule. Value, proximity to the main attractions and near the MRT are the best part of staying at the Cube."
"A perfect place for travellers. Very clean, center of China town, kind staffs ;)"
"Rustic vibe and beautiful decor to highlight the heritage home ambience.
Tucked away from the main road, and quiet neighbourhood. Keep in mind that this place is not a modern house. 1 min walk away from the main roads."
Really nice room and amazing location
"Kim helped us to book this beautiful room, so you save the hassle of filling in your details when compared to booking via other channels. 

Expect superb service from all the staff from One Farrer. The staff at the skyline lounge was very friendly and made our stay an unforgettable one. 

I trust Kim__ selection of premium hotel suites."
"Great host, great location"
"A very good place to stay in Singapore. It has a Good location, very near to the MRT . The room was very clean before u check in. Most importantly, Mary is a good manager who always gives me the quick responses and good assistance when i get into trouble. Thanks for her help again.oh and also the cleaner was really nice to me. It__ a unforgettable experience in here."
Mary was great host with quick response and sincere to make it smooth stay
Mary and Priscilla who helped me were amazing. Everything was exactly the way I saw it and was super clean. Unfortunately the China town has a bit of a walk up but it__ bang in the middle of a heritage part of China town called food street. It was so great that I missed being bang in the center of all that. The facility itself is amazing and the king place is great since you get your own washing and drying machine. Great stay at heritage in my second time and would highly recommend it.
"I had a really great time staying in the apartment. It is clean, stylish and homey. It has a perfect location with bus stop, mrt station and supermarket nearby along with lot and lot of food (there are lot of option of Halal food as well). Surprisingly, it is pretty quiet inside considering the crowd happening in the outside (tourist attraction place), perfect place to take a rest.
Mary and Priscilla were awesome. They gave me helpful advice for my stay, assisted with the check-in and check-out, checked me if there's anything I need that they could help to make my stay become more fantastic. It made me feel like I was in home. Couldn't be happier. Ten stars for the apartment and the staffs? Ow cmon, I'll give ten. :)
Highly recommended. 
Thank you so so much. :D"
"The location is right in the middle of the city and close to all major attractions. The place was clean and bed very comfortable. Mary was helpful and attentioned. She gave me some local tips and even gifted me some granola bars with a personalized note. Hosts were flexible with check-out time and kept my luggage safe until closer to my flight so that I could roam the city freely. 

Overall a great experience!"
"Great place to stay. Walking distance to the financial district and smack dab in the middle of the hustle and bustle of club st., and several nearby hawkers. Couldn__ have picked a better location."
"Very clean, and convenient having access to many great destinations in the city. The host was really responsive and supportive. Thank you."
"Great apartment, wonderfully located in Chinatown. Walking distance from the CBD and several metro stations. The space was very clean, check in went perfectly, they contacted me when I arrived at the airport and were waiting at the apartment (there is no front desk) to give me the keys and explain everything. There is a small gym for the guests and also washing and drying machines at disposal. You can also cook in the apartment, but honestly, with all the hawker centers nearby you really don't need to. You can eat out very cheap around the city. I definitely recommend it to everybody and will stay here next time on Singapore!"
"Clean and comfortable basically in the centre of the city, I couldn__ have asked for more :)"
Great location and ease of check-in.
"The room was clean and well presented. Part way through my stay the room was cleaned to a very high standard by Min. Mary was an exceptional host and was always available to answer questions and apply personal touches to the room. Great location and easy to get around. Would recommend for a short stay, especially if you do not have much luggage with you as the space is very small - but perfectly formed!"
Just book! It's everything you need in a trip. Better than any hotel nearby.
"The rooms are great and the layout is very good, we like it very much. The transportation is also very convenient. During the stay in Singapore, thanks to the help of Jarwin and Mary. They are very enthusiastic and can respond to and solve our problems in a timely manner, so that we have had a pleasant trip. I will still contact them the next time I go to Singapore. Thank you very much!"
Great accommodation and great location
Great place!
"I've stayed at 3 listings of Heritage Apartments so far and am simply amazed with the flexibility and service provided by the Guest Relations team. Whenever I contacted them with anything, they were prompt and provided a solution. Special thanks to Mary for arranging my stay, and to Ray, Cherry and Jarwin for being such great hosts!"
"Perfect location, convenient and close to landmarks and amenities. Super clean and as advertised and very well equipped. Great staff readily available to answer queries. Will stay again! :)"
"This was just what we needed: a convenient place to call home base in Singapore. With easy access to the MRT, a central location, essential kitchen amenities, and a clean and efficient space, it was just as advertised."
Excellent location and friendly hosts.  Also no problems with noise from other guest or neighbouring businesses.  100% recommend to anyone visiting.
It was a good stay! Big thanks Min and Mary for being flexible and helpful at all times. The location is fantastic.
The place is really great. The guest manager Mary was always just a call away and always ready to help. Thank you.
"Nice and very clean space. 
Check in and check out process is very fast and efficient. 
I had a great stay. Thank you."
"Host personally checked me in and we had a nice chat. Room is spacious, clean and ergonomic workspace is available. Highly recommended."
"good, valuable"
good
A nice place to stay. basically you get anything you need. nothing extraordinary but cozy enough to stay.
Good and quiet place
Location is great. Very good value for the price.
it's worth to stay :)
Great place to stop by. clean and spacious.
"Very nice place with convenient transportation and quiet environment. Close to local entertainment and cuisine area, very clean and neat. The host is very welcoming with great spirit of hospitality. Recommend to all guests around the world!"
Raymond was kind and nice. The place is clean and the room is spacious. Highly recommended place to stay when in Singapore.
"I recommend this place host is very responsive , place is clean and near mrt station and foods around"
"Place was near 2 bus stops and a train station, very easy to get around. Host was very responsive to messages also. Good place to stay for the price"
"Great place . Very convenient location , 5-7  min walk from aljunied mrt. Clean space . family friendly . Lots of places to eat nearby . Loved our stay . Easy check in and access ."
The owner is very informative on what to do and don'ts if you are a tourist gives awareness to us about the local rules in SG
a good place for stay

"The location is great except that the room looks bigger in the picture than the actual room size. I can say that it was not suitable for us, a family of five. And the bathroom is shared so it's a bit inconvenient to us. Other than that, i marvelled at the asian restaurants all around the place. Bus stop, Groceries and the likes are only a few steps away. Host is very responsive."

"This place is one of the cheapest available for a reason.. advertised as having a floor mattress but you will have to pay extra for this unless you are travelling with 5 people.. in which case this room will be very small. Also charges for detergent, duvet etc. No towels provided either. Not the best stay here to be honest but the city itself was nice."
Close to town.

The room and amities same as it was describe. Linda was very helpfull when i needed something. And the apartment was very clean. Near the airport but a little bit far from the city. The MRT station also a bit far from the apartment. But overall i like it and i might staying here again. Thank you
"Clean, comfortable, and reasonable for Singapore accommodations! We had a private room for four friends which was cozy but comfortable. Bathroom is shared with other guests so depending on who else is there, sometimes have to wait a few minutes or so _ wasn__ a problem for us."
"The place really clean, the host so friendly, the place really worth the price."
"This is a great location, very much accessible to the MRT, shops, and restaurant nearby. Don't expect too much because there are 5 rooms inside on the 7th floor. You shared the kitchen area & two comfort rooms with the total number of guest of the 5 rooms.

This accommodation is for travellers with tight budget, just to have a place to sleep & rest. Need to wake up early not to miss your itineraries, don't waste time by queueing just to use the bathroom.

Bathroom near the kitchen doesn't have bidet, best location is bedroom 3 & 4, just beside the comfort room with bidet, lavatory and hot shower.

B3 room is strictly for 5 guests, in my case we are 4 adults and 1 toddler aged 5.
We had an additional guest aged 2 and the male caretaker charged me $20 per day."
"The place is affordable and fairly accessible, and gets the job done for a quick stay in Singapore. AC worked well and was enough for a good nights rest."
"Good, clean place. Bathroom is shared with other apartments."
What you see is what you get.. Reasonable price located near all tourist destination!
"Apparemment bien placÃ© le long de la ligne reliant l__Ã©roport au centre ville. Chambre propre, simple et fonctionnelle. Sanitaires convenables."
Nice place to stay.. recomended..
The person is very nice
Great experience we had! We'll come back soon!
"Highly recommended for a group trip. The location is close to small restaurants. (Local Carenderia) 
The room is neat and clean.
Washing machine and Hot shower made me happy."
The place is ok.. Same as what is written.
Nice place for family
"Very good place for those who wants to travel with friends with budget stay, and hanging around all day. Air cond good! Wifi fast!"
"Schon im voraus, bekam ich ganz genaue Angaben wie ich die Unterkunft finde, mit Metroplan und allem. Das Zimmer war zweckmÃ¤ssig eingerichtet mit bequemen Betten und es war sehr sauber."
"Location is good,walking distance to MRT and bus stop."
"Good value for money, shared place but not crowded. Very clean room."
"This is worst booking, I have ever done on Airbnb, This guy asked me for $20 SGD extra for the infant with us. There is no privacy and washrooms are shared and you can't use it for long. Host behaviour is also rude."
Good place for a good people
"Clean, nice but not the biggest for five persons."
"Its another great experience staying here for my business trip, Heritage Apartments gives hotel service experience and It's my second time to stay  and will still recommend to  stay if i will be in Singapore.  Thank you for the great service will be back soon. Specially the quick response and communication of Mary it really helps alot to have someone who can ask regarding the things you use at the Apartment and advance notices for cleaning and well organize check in and check out process. Kudos"
"My stay at Heritage apartments was awesome - Mary was in contact with me from before day 1, and was super helpful and accomodating throughout. The attention to detail in the apartment and communication were absolutely top-notch, followed very closely by the apartment itself (notable mention to access to a Heritage Apartments Netflix account!). Felt well-looked after and cared for throughout. Would absolutely stay with Heritage Apartments again."
"So sorry,  I'm a bit late to write this review. This room is newly renovated. 
Amenities are complete. There are electric stove, refrigerator, washer, dryer, microwave, toaster, water heater, apple TV, iron, hair dryer, shampoo, bath gel, detergent, toilet & Kitchen tissue, kitchen utensil. Those all make me feel very comfortable and feel like at home. 
Though the room quite small but for me it's enough for 1 or 2 person. 

Guest Relations Officer, Mary, is really helpful, nice, friendly, fast response. She waited for me until late at night.  I was late for almost 3 hours  x_x
Even though I checked in very late, she still patiently showed me everything in the room and taught me how to use the washer/dryer, Apple TV, etc. Also show me the alternative exit door and express check out. 
Two thumbs up for Mary, really appreciate your hospitality. Thanks a lot. And thanks also for the Famous Amos  :-*

The room is very near to Chinatown MRT Station (Downtown line and North East Line) exit F. 
Chinatown Center, Food hawker (Maxwell), minimarket (7eleven, cheers), Chinatown point mall (Fair Price supermarket, Daiso, Song Fa), Chinatown complex (cheap souvenir and food hawker), People's Park, etc are within walking distance."
"The Apartment is new and clean. Convenient location just 3 minutes from Chinatown MRT. However, in the afternoon due to renovation work at neighbour is abit noisy."
"We had an excellent stay at Heritage apartments at their 229 South Bridge Road location. We were right on the cusp of Chinatown and Boon Tat Street neighborhoods, with an abundance of attractions, restaurants, and night life right at our doorstep. Plus, the Chinatown train station was a quick 5 min walk. Although we used the train quite a bit (it helped to get out of the humidity), we were also able to walk to many major tourist destinations within 20-30 min, if we wanted. The Heritage Apartments team was quick to respond to our questions and requests. We had to use the after hours check in due to our late arrival, which worked well. Also, they accommodated our next day in person check in to the following day so we could do Universal Studios on Christmas Day per our plans. Mary went the extra mile by noticing the brand of museli bars we had brought with us for snacks and left us a box when our apartment was cleaned. This was a surprising and thoughtful extra touch. She also advised us on questions we had about where things were located, sometimes after hours. We had an evening flight and the team provided secure baggage holding services so we could check out, enjoy our day, and retrieve them when we were ready to go to the airport. The apartment was very clean, the once a week housekeeping services were nice, and it had all the amenities we needed (kitchen, wifi, laundry, AIR CONDITIONING, Apple TV, etc).

Some items to note for those trying to decide whether this Airbnb is right for you. 

1. Our apartment was big enough for 1 person or a couple. The bathroom wasn't very private (could see into it through glass and could hear the other person's movements).

2. Our apartment had stairs that were on the steeper side with slender steps so if this is an issue check out their other apartment configurations.

3. We have a medium firm mattress at home and the mattress in the apartment was much firmer. We slept well on it but if you prefer a softer mattress than this is something to be aware of when choosing these apartments.

We would highly recommend Heritage Apartments. It was an excellent place to stay."
"Wow, great apt, great location, great service. This place is tremendous value. Location is great just around the corner from MRT, Chinatown and Maxwell Hawker Center. Clean, modern and brand new. Thanks to Cherry and team!"
"The location is right by Chinatown and within minutes you can get to Chinatown MRT or Telok Ayer MRT stations. Even though Chinatown is busy, the location of the BnB is not noisy at all. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely make future reservations!"
"This was the perfect place for me, as I was staying in Singapore for a 2-week business trip. It was easily accessible to the MRT lines and was situated in between the more touristy parts of Chinatown and some of the trendy local hotspots that I went out to with my friends.

While the apartment was small, it's efficiently planned and I had everything I needed for a short-term stay. I felt like I had a home for the past couple weeks. Mary and the team were great hosts and always available if I needed anything."
"I had a great stay at Heritage Apartments. Mary was very accommodating. I had a room switch and she helped me move my luggage and brought me items I had left behind. Heritage is right in the heart of Chinatown and convenient for walking to MRT. It's quiet, unlike some places along Club St., and it was a great home away from home for the week."
I had an excellent 2 week stay. Mary who is the guest check in person was fabulous. She was on time and very helpful. It would good to meet people as good as her. I will be staying there next month and hopefully using the same room. Excellent place.
"Great location. Lots of restaurants and bars around club street. 

Definitely try the nasi lemak at Coconut Club. Also the beer at Little Creatures."
"I stayed in Heritage Apartments Chinatown for 15 days. The location is super convenient, the area is really nice. The apartment itself was small but it is in a pristine shape and sparkling clean. Property manager Mary has been super helpful, and responded to each of my queries within minutes. I strongly recommend!"
"I'd enjoyed my stay at Heritage Apt  very much because of the great location, the cleanliness, the service. Definitely will return..."
Mary and Priscilla were great hosts. Highly recommended if you want convenient to both transportation and food.
"A great little unit in a good location. My ground floor studio had no windows, but the place was well-lit enough with indoor lighting that this never bothered me too much. Mary was a great host, and always went the extra mile to make us feel at home!"
"The best Airbnb I have ever stayed at! The room was compact, very quiet (even though there were bars front and back of the block), in a well-lit area, super clean and had all the amenities you need, including your own front loader and dryer. There's also a small gym room to work off all the delicious eats! In terms of location, I think the apartment was at the best location as there was a major bus stop around the corner, Telok Ayer station a few minutes walk and Chinatown station also a few minutes walk. You can get fresh and cheap fruit a few minutes away at Chinatown Complex, a decent feed at the nearby hawker centres (Amoy St Food Centre, Maxwell Food Centre, Chinatown Complex Food Centre and Lau Pa Sat) + special shout-out to the 90 year old granny manning Nam Seng Noodle House and many cultural sights nearby such as one of the oldest Chinese temples in Singapore, the Sri Mariamman Temple and the Chinatown Heritage Centre.  A special shout-out has to go to our customer service manager Mary. My partner and I arrived in SG at 3 am having barely slept a wink and desperately needing to at least offload some luggage and maybe take a shower too. We were checking out the location of our Airbnb and by chance, bumped into Mary outside! Mary swiftly checked us in before check-in time and we were able to take a quick rest before exploring the town. Mary also helped me organise a surprise birthday cake for my partner and organised luggage storage on our last day as our flight back to Sydney was at 2 am. Thank you Mary for taking good care of us and I will definitely recommend you and this Airbnb to all my friends and family :)"
"Great experience, every aspect of the stay surpassed expectations."
Beautiful small place for 2 people. Location is really good for traveling (front of Chinatown and near MRT). Best place for recommendations. â­__â­__â­__â­__â­__
"I was upgraded to a slightly different location due to a technical issue with the apartement I chose at first. At first I was  a bit worried about the location  (in the middle of the food street in Chinatown)  thinking it might be noisy. But I could barely hear the streetnoise, more likely could hear the neighbours switching on the light :D Anyway the location was great, close to MRT and different bars and restaurants, downtown area in walking distance. Pricilla was very helpful and such a sweetheart. Would use their service again."
Great location close to downtown
"Great location, nice and well equipped room, very helpful host."
"I really loved and enjoyed the stay in Heritage Apartments!

Due to the late arrival, I had to check-in after the working hours. 

The day before check-in, I received a thoughtful email with pictures and videos how to access to my accommodation. 

The next day, manager M waited and helped me with the check-in process. She was really friendly and helpful.

My accommodation didn__ have a window. But I didn__ need to open the main door because there were no issues with the air-cycling and the air conditioning worked really well during my 2 weeks of stay.

Cleaning service was done every once a week and no need to say more, it__ was just outstanding.

Location was really nice. Chinatown & the MRT station was really close and many spots were within the walking distance. Personally recommend the Maxwell food-place."
It can__ get better than Heritage apartments. Apart from rooms being too small to manage everything is so perfect for this location. Great amenities and great location which helps you to make your life super easy in china town.
"GREAT LOCATION!! So close to the train. Not far from Marina Bay Sands and Orchard road. Chinatown food centre across the road for hawker food. Cute cafes and authentic coffee shops. Clean and tidy. Modern. A bit small, but fine. 

Tip: you can store your luggage under the bed to give you some space back. 

The street is quiet, even on weekends. No street noise really. You can hear neighbouring apartment doors open/close/lock occasionally. But it__ not too bad. 

Wifi drops/struggles to connect occasionally. Netflix on TV doesn__ work well, the internet connection doesn__ work great. But we just watched on our iPad/phones and the connection was fine. 

Great water pressure for shower. Bathroom is quite large, a good size. 

Having a laundry in the room was handy. The dryer didn__ dry things super dry sometimes. But we just hung clothes in the apartment and it dried within the day. 

Friendly hosts. Great location. Would stay again. Would recommend to friends."
"Place is clean and really convenient to walk to MRT or market. Everything is described as they say. A little remind is the place is smaller than you imagined. Well, Singapore is not big though. But overall is pretty good."
"I was relocate to 28 Smith Street, location just inside China Town Market if you like to stay inside there.
No noise at night as of sound proof glass, room a bit small / narrow but ok for short stay."
"It was an amazing experience staying with Heritage Apartments. Warmly welcomed by Priscilla, she__ responsible and gave many food advice. The location of the apt is good just 5 min walk from MRT, during which you can walk through Chinatown. Thx again for hosting;)"
"The place is quite small, but has everything u need. And enough space for two.
Suitable for long stays. You can do laundry and even ion your clothes. Light cooking is also possible.
Suitable for couples / solo. The bathroom door is transparent.

Apartment was clean. The AC was cold. The shower water pressure was great. Bed was quite stiff which i like. Fridge smelled like durian though. O and they provide netflix. 

The neighborhood is busy; but my room was facing the back of the apartment, so it was peaceful. 

Location is good. Close to Chinatown station, exit A, pagoda rd. Nevertheless, the way to apartment is not fully covered (outdoor), so if it rains, you will need an umbrella to walk to/from the station.
Lots of restaurants and cafes and bars nearby. 

O they do not have lift. So might need to walk up the stairs.

And mary as the __alking front desk_ was very helpful."
Nice place!
Love love love heritage so much. Stayed both at chinatown as well as bugis heritage. Both cleanliess is tip top. Cozy and amenities are on point. Love how both mary and bill for both location handles with the check in and check out. Thank you both will definitely come bk to heritage again!!
Great
The apartment was very clean with lots of natural lighting. Great location near Chinatown and the MRT. There was a hiccup at check in but Mary took care of the problem ASAP! She was a great host and I would definitely come back.
Good value for the location. It's a micro-apartment but was very functional for one person.
This is our 2nd time to stay on their listing. Great hosts and timely responses. Listing is as described and is in perfect location. They took care of my colleagues. Highly recommended for business travelers. Definitely on our top list of listing for our next business travel.
"Great stay! The room was quite a bit smaller than I expected, but I think that's par for the course in Singapore. 

Location was incredible. 5-10 minute walk from every office, meeting, and restaurant I needed to go to."
"Good stay 
Good Host 
Thank you Mary "
Great place to stay!
"Everyone we interacted with at Heritage Apartments was friendly and professional, but it is super frustrating that their listings are not accurate representations of where you will actually stay. It seems like their policy is to let guests book any listing on Airbnb, regardless of if it is actually available, and then they ultimately place you in any ""similar"" unit that they have unoccupied in the neighborhood. So for anyone who pays attention when you book, don't expect to get an apartment with the same layout as listed. The units are clean and new, but not particularly thought out in the way that an airbnb with an independent host often is - they lack some thoughtful features such as switches near the bed or a dresser in the bedroom. The sloped ceiling upstairs means we whacked out heads often and there wasn't enough light to see inside our suitcases at night when we arrived (they were kind enough to provide a desk lamp the next day). There is no outlet in the bathroom or anywhere that you can use an appliance near a mirror. Laundry detergent was provided which was nice. The windows do a good job of keeping the busy street noise out, but there are only blackout curtains, no sheers, and since they face the street and are in front of the bathroom you pretty much have to keep them closed unless you plan to get dressed immediately after showering and before leaving the bathroom. Bed was very firm but comfortable. They were able to accommodate self check-in for our late arrival. Overall it was an acceptable stay, and hopefully they will address some of their apartment's kinks and continue to improve."
.
Sparking clean. Friendly host with fast response.
"Lived in Sg for 10 yrs and now there temporarily for work. Fantastic place, valde and service. Strongly recommend"
I definitely recommend this play. i used to stay in singapore and got back after a year. so regarding my experience the location is great. the apt is clean and Mary makes you feel like home.
Amazing space and perfect location. Would most certainly repeat my stay! Keep up the good work!
"Mary was so helpful and pleasant, available 24/7 for every issue. The place was a bit small for my needs but the hospitality was great. Highly recommended."
Has everything you need and nothing you don__ in a super convenient location
"Great apartment with the best house managers! Thank you so much, Priscilla & Arynna, for being so nice and warm and helpful. Hope to see you again on my next trip to Singapore:)"
"Heritage Apartments is really a great place to stay. We stayed in the Chinatown facility - very central, sparkling clean. The building is recent and you will find all the comfort that you need for a short or a long stay. Mary and Priscilla were amazing and made our stay so comfortable that we felt welcomed and at home immediately.
Definitely a place to stay. 
Nothing related to Heritage Apartment : simple warning to all the tourists coming to Singapore. Only licensed owners can rent short term. This is the case of Heritage Apartment of course. Airbnb cannot grant you all the listing are legal so check twice before booking. Regarding Heritage Apartment you can go there eyes closed ! They know what they are doing and they do it well !"
Amazing apartment that you can see the the host thought about all the small details
Great stay... lovely loft with all the amenities. Location is excellent as a central point for exploring the city with the subway within a few minutes walk. I__e wanted to stay in this area for sometime and it didn__ disappoint. Well managed and good communications with the hosts. Recommended!
"Very nice apartment in a great location. The apartment has everything you need, and Mary & Priscilla are really helpful and made everything very easy! Would definitely stay again!"
"This was a fabulous location and close to the MRT. As a female traveling alone, I felt very safe walking in the neighborhood. The apartment was immaculate and super clean. I loved the layout with the desk, kitchen, bathroom downstairs and bed in the loft. AC units in both areas. Communication with management was super accessible. Thank you!!"
"Lovely stay, would definitely book again for my next work trip to SG"
This is a great little studio in a very good location. The place is clean and well maintained. I highly recommend it and will stay here again in the future.
"I extended my stay in this unit for another 2 weeks.   That__ how much I like the unit.  It__ clean and stylish and perfect for one person.  Everything you need (groceries, food etc) is within a 5-10 mins walk. Highly recommended."
Will surely go back there!!!
"the apartment looks really new and clean!! perfect for staycation!! thank you for being a great host, rid and mary!!"
"The place is clean but no towels for the guests. But if you're in a budget, this is a good choice."

"Nice room, CLEAN & AFFORDABLE PRICE"
perfect yet affordable place to stay
Presentable but smoky environment at doorstep and smell of smoke everywhere.
Very spacious room. Highly recommended. Good communication.
The host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
"The apartment is sparkling clean and roomy located just a few minute walk to Orchard road. Hannah is very nice and helpful. We totally enjoy the surrounding and peaceful environment, can't believe we are in the middle of the most famous shopping street in SG! The living room is just like in the photo. There is no bedroom photo on Airbnb at the time we booked but the bedroom and private bathroom are as just great. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful place. We definitely want to go back there again."
The place OK. Very harmful & kind Host!
"We had a great stay at Hannah's place. It was very nice and very clean, with the possibility to use the pool and fitness, which we didn't even have time to do. We only briefly met Hannah on our last evening, but she left all the instructions for us and when needed, she was very responsive to our messages. Also, we loved her recommendations about good food nearby,  we had some delicious meals there."
Good place to stay!! This place is amazing but far from MRT
"Hannah is great host, open and very helpful. 
The house was near Orchard rd, far from MRT but its ok if you like walking."
Great Place but very small room for 3 guest. Other than that everything about the place is good.
"å¾__ä¾,è·___°é___¸¸è¿,_ºé_å¾__ä¾"
Emily's place is very ideal as it's location is fantastic (5 mins walk to MRT which serves 2 lines) and she responded very timely to my requests.
Emily ist sehr hilfsbereit und flexibel in der Check in zeit. Es hat alles super geklappt und die Nutzung des Pools ist super. Mit der Bahn kommt man schnell von der Unterkunft in Richtung Stadt.
"Stay at a quiet, nice & cosy place with good eateries nearby. Located at walking distance to Paya Lebar MRT for convenience of travelling."
Good and convenient place to stay
Recommended Place during your short trip getaway.
"Fast respond, clean, convenient and good environment!"
Will book again when I'm back to SGP
"Great place and location with malls situated all within walking distances. Abundance of food choices around. Relatively quiet with occasionally noises from trains passing by the nearby train station which is actually within walking distance, that's a convenience.

Convenient place for moving around the city. MRT and Bus Interchange is walk-able distance.

"Amazing time at Simon's place. He is very fun and friendly. My friend and I had a great stay at his place. He showed us some local eateries and  introduced us to some delicious food and drinks. Very clean apartment with 2 beautiful balconies that overlooks Singapore. Thank you for being so kind to us!

P.S. hundo P recommend his place to anyone looking to have an amazing time in Singapore :)"
"Excellent location, will stay again!"

"Great place, great host, great location"
Good for the price. Place is near 2 MRT stations. Walking distance to Mustafa!

"This apartment has a superb location in terms of proximity to the MRT station and Marina Bay Sands. You can actually watch the light show from the apartment. It is within short walking distance to the hawker centre Lau Pa Sat, an interesting place with variety of delicious and affordable local food.
The apartment is clean and modern. Nathan was a lovely host. Very accommodating, friendly and flexible."
Great location!! Amazing views and would stay here again. Great and seamless communication!
"NathanÂ´s place is just amazing- the best location ever and it also has 4 swimming pools and nice leisure area. Nathan is a super-host, who answers quickly and gives local tips. Recommend to book his place!!!"
"Great place, excellent stay and a helpful and understanding host!!"
Amazing Apartment. Very clean and very spaceous. Loved our stay at the apartment.
"Host Nathan is easy to communicate with and provides all info we needed (i.e. where to get food, places to go, etc.) He even accompanied us as he was giving directions. His place is clean and literally close by & looking at the marina so you'll see the light displays happening in the evenings right off the windows. Also his place is close to Lau Pau Sat hawker street and in another direction the restaurants as you go towards the Merlion of Singapore. I will recommend & stay again in his place whenever we're back in Singapore."

Very enjoyable trip! Take a walk around Marina Bay every day. The Merlion and Sands can be reached on foot. There is a bus stop opposite the apartment. There are also self-service bicycles. There is a mall in the basement of the apartment. There are food and supermarkets from all over the world.
"Superb location, great view and an amazing building with pools and jacuzzi and even a viewing gallery on the 44th floor that is breathtaking. We're an Australian family of 4 adults and we stayed for 1 week. The location is on the Downtown line along which are some great touristy destinations such as Bugis, China Town. Bayfront etc so everything is super handy and only a few stops away."
"Worse than my expectation. Slow response from host. On the other hand, the location is superb."
"Very clean and convenient location.  Access to pools was a plus, providing a lovely way to relax after a full day of sightseeing.  Easy to use public transport to get anywhere you need to go."
"Nathan's apartment is fantastic central situated with walking distance to a lot of interesting places (Marina Bay, Hawkers Market, Boat Quay, China Town, Clark Quay_.). Further there is a recreation area between the two towers with several Pools, Jacuzzi,  Ping Pong Table, Tennis, Work Out. Under the tower is a Mall with restaurants, supermarket etc. which is really practical (once in a while it rains in Singapore). We would definitely stay here next time we come to Singapore :)."
"Nathan was an outstanding host! His quick communication and attention to the smallest details were spot on. If there was something we needed, he was quick to deliver. The apartment was one of the nicest we've stayed in; it was sparkling clean; the views of the bay, surrounding buildings, and Marina Bay Sands with the light/water show were spectacular; the location is amazing--so easy to navigate the city from it's central location; everything about the apartment and host were well beyond a 5-star rating!!  Hope we can get back to Singapore again--we would definitely make that our choice in the place to stay!  Thanks again, Nathan, for helping make our Singapore vacation truly spectacular! We very much appreciate it!"
"Nathan is a great host, we had a lovely stay in marina bay, what we love most was the view, and surrounding areas which is great for a morning jog around marina bay and garden by the bay. Rooms are clean, and we were provided some great amenities. Thank you nathan."
Nathan is a very helpful and accommodating host - the apartment is sparkling clean and at a fantastic location with a swiping view of the marinas. Would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a place to stay in Singapore!
"Great location in Marina Bay - there__ a MRT right below the building as well as a mini mall with tons of restaurants and grocery stores for convenience. You could also walk about 5 minutes across the street to get to the Marina Bay mall, the hotel/casino that connects to the Gardens of the Bay. It is access via keycard which was difficult since we only had one with a group of four. Otherwise it was a great stay. Easy Grab ride to the hawker centers as well."
"Amazing host ever, nice view for fire work."
Nathan's house is clean and in a great location in the centre of town. The house has a very good view. The last two days we had a little problem with hot water. Nathan solved it immediately. Recommend Nathan's house!
"Nathan__ cozy home is Fantastic! It__ the best choice for us to make to stay at this house. The department is very neat. From the windows u can see  Marina Bay Sands. The host prepared a lot of things for us which is very considerably.Nathan is super friendly and hospitality. In the CBD area, very near to the Marina bay sands and Merlion statue. Also the famous old building as known as Lau Pa Sat. We really love this house and also thanks Nathan!!"

"The host owner was very welcoming.  The best Locations. Near metro and have supermarket,convenient , clean room.

"This is by far the best place to stay in Singapore , the view is amazing and the apartment is very spacious. Its overlooking the marina bay sands . Nathan has been a great host and the experience was truly amazing."
"Fantastic location and fantastic host 
Just 2 min from underground but we used taxis few times to Sentosa - only 12 min and $10!!
Rest of time walk as so central for everything as right on the marina avenue 
Basic Appartment living but everything good and everything clean and great pool area on 8th floor 
Mall in levels below so everything you need for grocery etc 
Nathan is so great and willing to communicate and work with 
Not luxury but very nice"

"Had a wonderful stay at Nathan's place. The price is absolutely worth the premium you pay as you are right in front of Singapore's signature Marina Bay Sands, Merlion and Gardens by the Bay - all of them walkable from the listing.

I have stayed in multiple Airbnbs before but I especially loved the fact that Nathan was indeed sharing his own place with us and had not segregated an area for guests or set up his place to exclusively host guests. Everything Nathan owns is right in that place and openly visible (well of course, use your judgement on what you should use or shouldn't, better still if you check with him) but I think the trust Nathan puts in his guests goes to say a lot about his generous hospitality. 

The mattresses were of just perfect firmness and we slept like a log for the three nights we were there. Most of the places have either too soft or too hard mattresses but these were just the right balance in comfort and plushness. The kitchen was fully equipped and had everything you need to cook from scratch or reheat if ordering from Grab / Foodpanda. The three swimming pools with exercise machines were a delight to use and have fun in.

Plenty of options to eat nearby and Nathan also knows a very kind Uncle Sam who can drive you around a nominal cost around Singapore in a very luxurious Toyota Noah MPV that can seat 5-6 people. 

I would highly recommend Nathan's place and would definitely love to stay here when visiting Singapore next time."
Very professional
Location is excellent in front of Marina Bay and nearby Downtown metro station.
"Excellent location with a million dollar view.  Ample amenities and eateries around the place. Easy access to many attractions as it is within walking distance to 2 different MRT stations.
Communication with host was excellent and check in was a breeze."
Great view of MBS. Nathan was quick to communicate and a nice host overall.
"Great place overall. The window are see through, might something to consider if you don__ stay with your love one."
Had a great stay ! Room was clean and has a nice design to it. Location is really near the mrt as well !
"Budget hotel, conveniently located near MRT station and in the middle of Chinatown."
Cozy space and amazing location! Very convenient to get around :-)
Easy check-in and check-out process. Very close to the mrt and mall!
"Good spot, very accommodating host. Kelvin was kind enough to loan me some money for my cab on arrival, which i was very grateful for. I would recommend this place."
No windows or ventilation.
Amazing and affordable place
"__¸¸ä¾¿å____é»,ä¹¾æ·¨ä¸_¾¿_"
Cleanliness can be improved. The walls were quite dirty and sides of the bed had dust and hair remaining although the cleaner just cleaned the place.
ä¸__
"Space was clean and adequate for two. Location was very convenient, surrounded by many food places and easy access to public transport"
Probably the best valued airbnb near the central area.
"Always be adventurous if you wanna stay outdoors during the night. Prepare mosquito repellents before the sun sets and when it gets dark to avoid attacks. Toilet wise, be sure to prepare a bicycle in case your tent is far from the toilet. It could be one hell of an effort to go to the toilet especially when it's far."
Spacious. Nice setup.  Love the decor with all the fairy lights and exceptionally beautiful at night. Will definitely be back again. Thank you Glampingkaki.
"Great place to stay, fantastic hosts. At the isolated end of East Coast, so felt a bit more separated from the hustle bustle of the main park area"
"A nicely set up tent for u with proper fan n some inflatable mattress, the only down side is only available for Singaporean, PR n permit holders which is a regulation by NEA."
"Great spacious tent. Fortunately our tent was pitched under a tree and had shade. Extra batteries were also provided, just in case the fairy lights is out of batt. No insects got into the tent. Bed was comfortable too."
Good price for value
Highly recommended
"Not quite a hotel style apartment, but Ken and Rain are both lovely and the apartment is in a great spot. The mall across the road is also pet friendly. 

We stayed with our dog and were very grateful to be able to have her with us. The place smelt beautiful and you wouldn__ know that there had been pets there. 

The complex is clean and quiet - we had some pool noise but that__ to be expected. It felt a little cluttered when we were there but it was the first letting and I__ sure they will take some of our suggestions on board as they are keen to host more people. 

When comparing the price of this property to others, it probably isn__ the quality I would have expected but it was a lovely stay all the same. I have provided pricing feedback."
Ken and Rain were quick with responses and helpful as well! The place is also very conveniently located.
"Fantastic hosts!  The apartment is in a very good, quiet area with lots of restaurants nearby.  It was very clean but you should be aware its quite a small space and no cleaning services so might not be well suited for a long stay.    Definitely try the Italian restaurant on the 1st floor and the Japanese yakitori just down River Valley road on the opposite side."
very very responsive and superb view of swimming pool
"Amazingly friendly & helpful hosts, check in was prompt and efficient as well. Really nice cosy place with more than enough amenities for a family. _"
"The room is cozy and clean, and have direct access to a swimming pool. There__ a supermarket nearby. It__ really a very nice experience staying here."
Good
The place is well maintained and clean. Amenities are well provided. Ken and Rain are also very prompt with their replies. Highly recommended.
Beautiful and extremely (Hidden by Airbnb) mable. Its location is convenient for going out partying in the evening and looking for good food in the morning. The pool is so convenient that jumping into the pool is almost instinctual. Ken and Rain are both extremely good hosts who attend to your every need and reply promptly. Definitely would recommend for short getaways and the such!
"Ken and Rain were responsive, delightful hosts. Their home was immaculate and just as shown in the pictures. Had a lovely staycation and would recommend to anyone looking to do the same. Cheers!"
Ken was very helpful and proactive in making sure my friends and I were comfortable. He was also always ready to answer any questions we had for the amenities.
Great hospitality. Went to extra mile for us having a great in their place. Love the projector in the bedroom. Great place for chill out.
"I just want to highlight Ken's hospitality and service. He went above and beyond as a host and ensured everything I needed for a relaxed, comfortable and trouble-free stay was taken care of. The place is very cosy for a single or couple to enjoy, and the bedroom cinema was a plus for Netflix watching."
Spot on place in a great location
"Ken and Rain are really friendly and were super accommodating to us when we arrived and were always available throughout our stay to answer any questions. Their place is also beautiful, spotless and in a great location! I will definitely be back again!"
"Amazing hosts with immediate responsiveness. The place is located in a very good area close to everything you might need. 

Very quite so you can rest during both night and day.

I would highly recommend it."
"Ken and Rain were the best Airbnb hosts I have ever had! Their place is located conveniently in the River Valley neighborhood, surrounded by great restaurants, shopping, parks, & markets that are within easy walking distance. They had all of the creature comforts for us such as plentiful and high quality toiletries, towels, silverware, speakers, tv, etc. The private pool access from the balcony was nothing short of magical! It was also literally the longest and cleanest pool I__e ever been in. I stayed there for my birthday and Rain & Ken went out of their way to make it super special, including delivering a gorgeous and delicious cake to the doorstep on my birthday eve.  When I told Ken I am a chef traveling to research food, he sent a well-curated and delicious list of foods and restaurants. These were much appreciated gestures & are just some of the many ways they went out of their way to make our stay memorable, comfortable, and fun! Communication & responsiveness was also top notch. Clearly I can__ say enough good things about our hosts. I would highly recommend their place to anyone visiting Singapore or any locals looking for a special place to staycation.  We will definitely come back to stay next time we are in Singapore!"
"The location is great. There__ a 24 hour restaurant within walking distance. Just downstairs there__ a wine store, massage place and food options as well as a marketplace within walking distance. The pool is the perfect temperature and the house has all you need. Washer, dryer, ac, fridge, strip pole, karaoke, a disco ball! We were here for my partners birthday and we really enjoyed our stay. Ken & rain also gave us great food recommendations and rain took Me with her to dance class! A great experience all around."
"Clean place, very convenient location, small and cozy, lots of thoughtful touches and things to use in the apartment, very nice host! Will definitely stay again!"
Ken & Rain was very nice & lovely. We loved stay in they__e apartment. The location also great. Near to everywhere tourists needs. Thank you for having us as guest :) Hope we can meet again!
"The place is awesome,  especially the pool.  Ken was very helpful.  Loved our stay would surely visit again"
Lovely people and loved the pool!
"Super friendly host who genuinely want our visit to be enjoyable one. Very responsive and showing care to the guess. The place is close to some fine restaurants, seven eleven and two shopping malls. And.. it is fully loaded with some high tech toys :) which is a plus"

Located in a quieter part of town and very easy access to the pool right outside the home. Ken also responds to messages really promptly and was nice of him to check my friends and I in personally by showing us all the amenities and facilitates available at home.
"Ken's the most hospitable Airbnb host I ever met! Really great guy, personally picked me up and drove me to his place, and even showed me some of Singapore. The place itself is just as described, really cool pool, and great location!"
"We had a great time at this apartment, it was exactly as expected and in a convenient location. Only 20 mins from the airport. The hosts were super communicative and kindly arranged a pick up from the airport for us. This was the perfect place for our unexpected stopover in Singapore and the hosts were amazing from pre-check in to post-check out."
"Great location, clean, stylish apartment perfect for couples."

"For people who seek for quiet and not so crowded neighborhood near orchard, this is the place you looking for!"
Great host!
Ken was such a hospitable host. He greeted us personally and took us on a tour of the amenities and the house. Detailed instructions on the usage of the appliances and manuals of the equipments in the house. Prompt responses and yes we truly enjoyed the projector in the bedroom. We have our own in house karaoke and even screening of movie. Played the card games provided too. Overall amazing!
"Ken is a great host. He's very commnicative, willing to help.
Upon arriving, he explained things carefully. 
His house is  perfect for 2 persons. There are washing & drying machine, microwave, etc.
The pool is just in front of your terrace. It's an amazing pool, I love it."
"These hosts were extremely helpful with all our needs and had amazing hospitality. The pool was also lovely and was awesome to have right outside our door! The actual apartment was a lot smaller than we expected however, and the dancing pole did not work and was very unstable which was a bummer. For the size and value of the apartment I think it was a little over priced but the hosts were lovely"
"Very Nice and design appartment, clean and quiet.
Ken is very very kind and helpfull, thank you again."
Nice pad
Great host. Fast replies. Easy check-in and out. You pay for what you get. Would recommend 
"A cosy space that grows on you, with minimal disturbance and great value for money."
The host provides a clear check in instruction from A - Z.

"I had the most amazing time at Betty__. She arranged airport pick up and personally welcomed me and showed me the apartment and facilities. Outstanding ospitale and 5 stars all the way. Highly recommended, a true pearl."
Die Unterkunft war sauber und genau wie beschrieben! FÃ¼r 4 Personen ausreichend! Hat uns gut gefallen!
"Very good location. Around 20 minutes by walk to Marina Bay Sends.
Very close to MRT station and food court.
Oner working with team, responding very fast. Last day we had late night airport departure and owner allowed us to keep luggage till evening."
It was a great experience - first timer at recording a song and David helped to make the atmosphere very comfortable. He's quite the professional and his passion for (producing) music is evident and I wish him all the best in taking some Singaporean artists to the next level.  Strongly recommended!
"Location is fantastic. Apartment is new and suitable for a base to explore Singapore. I would say it's not ideal if you plan on spending alot of time inside since the living spaces are tiny. The linen, pillows and especially the towels all could use an upgrade otherwise all good. No problems around checkin. Clear instructions etc"
"Comfortable but small-ish, which is normal in downtown Singapore. Close to MRT and hawker centers, and there's a convenient taxi stand. Awesome views from the pool!"
"Very good, central location. Apartment was generally as described. Bedrooms, kitchen and bathroom were very clean. Good washer/dryer unit and nice refrigerator. We received one bath towel for each of us, delivered a few hours after check in. While not a problem, this did seem a bit odd. Access to the two swimming pools is very nice. Check in was easy and host was communicative. It is small, but it__ not a problem if you spend most time exploring Singapore."
"Great central apartment , close to great eating places and perfect size to accomodate our family of 4.  Was great having a pool available to cool down in!  Would recommend !"
"This place is in a great location downtown, in particular if you're there for work, but it's also just a couple blocks from some of the best little restaurants and clubs in Singapore.  Downside is it's quite a squeeze for a two-bedroom place.  Also the building is pretty hostile to airbnb (as is pretty much all of Singapore apparently) so you have to be a bit careful though we didn't have a problem."
Great place with e great view from the balcony. Food court just across the street. Near seven eleven and MRT station too.
"It__ a gorgeous place right next to excellent inexpensive places to eat and a stones throw away from the MRT train station. 

The view from the balcony is priceless. 

I love the pool & gym!"
Comfortable flat in a great location.
Compact clean appartment in central location. Food and shops available. Building has nice pools.
Great Place! Close to MRT Stations (Raffle Place and Telok Ayer are within 300 meters) and very close to Marina Bay

"Ben is a super host. He was very communicative when we arrive ! How come from airport to flat etc . First day we had a problem with WiFi . He directly came to solve the problem. He didn__ manage to do it so he was here the day after with a 4G key! Just to say that he is very reactive et very attentive to the visitors. I recommend for
Everybody!

All was great - thank you!

 It is a very clean place. In addition, the apartment is very well equipped. This includes for instance a washing machine (including available washing powder - very attentive!), a hair dryer, a kitchen with all the necessary  and so on...
The check-in and check-out run very smoothly and we appreciate Ben's flexibility. For a small extra fee Ben was even as kind as to extend the check-out period for around half a day what helped us a lot. All in all, it was a great and unproblematic stay and we can definitely recommend it!"

"Great location for a stay in Singapore, walking distance of main attractions or the MRT to get anywhere else you desire. Hosts were easily contactable and apartment met all our needs"
"Great location, communication always very quick. Tiny apartment but good enough for couple nights. And the chocolate from Ben was a nice way to welcome guests. I would come back again."
"Ben__ Concrete jungle is right in the heart of things, just minutes from the MTR , about a 10 minute walk to Chinatown and some of Singapore__ main attractions. Taxis are plentiful just 100 meters to the right up Robinson Road. No breakfast provided but Lau Pa Sat hawker centre is outside the front door and there is a great cafe just 4 minutes walk away in Telok Ayer Street (corner of Boon Tat St) called Sarnies. (Best coffee in Singapore and a beautiful temple Thian Hock Keng a stone__ throw away.) The apartment is very small but a great base from which to discover the city."
The apartment is great. In a great location with a great view. I would stay again.

"Loved it at Ben__ place. Clean, good location, great amenities. Across the road from food places and a short walk to MRT and public buses. We really enjoyed the pools and Ben was very prompt to answer any questions. Definitely will stay again."
"Super central location (right across Lau pa Sat food court, near MRT, walking distance to marina bay); comfortable unit (great beds, hot shower, internet/netflix, usable kitchen,...); very responsive host. We could not have wished for anything better!"
"We__e first time visitors to Singapore. Ben__ place really made our visit to Singapore memorable. His condo unit was just as we had expected. Restaurants, food courts and tourist spots are all accessible by foot or by Grab. Enjoyed our 10 minutes walk to Chinatown. Will definitely stay here again on our next vacation to Singapore."
Had a great 5 days here. Check in and communication was excellent and whilst the space is quite small it was enough for 3 of us.  Pool areas were nice and location was superb. Would recommend. Thanks again Ben.
"Amazing place with good price and the best possible location in entire Singapore. It is very convenient to go to places. Very safe, quiet and private place. The host was very easy to communicate with. Would recommend 10/10"
"A real gem of a place! This spot is the perfect walking distance between both Lavender and Bendemeer MRT stations, making it easy to get anywhere on the Green or Blue lines. The room itself was quite simple and comfortable: there's a twin size bed, a wardrobe with two drawers at  the bottom, and a desk with a chair.  And of course, all the basic amenities: air conditioning, a towel, and most importantly, Wi-fi :)

Checking in was a breeze, and communication between me and the host was quick and efficient. The place has 2 toilets and 2 showers in a shared area outside the room (there's 3 stalls, and one of them is a hybrid), though it's quite rare for all of them to be used up at the same time, so that wasn't a problem for me. Also, there's a 23-hour Indian restaurant about a minute's walk up the street, so if you're hungry at 3 in the morning then you're all set. There's also a 7-11 about a 5 minute walk away.

Some things to note: the walls are quite thin, so sometimes you can hear the neighboring tenants if they're on the phone or playing loud music. At the beginning of the stay you're provided with a single roll of toilet paper, so if you need more you'll have to provide it yourself. And lastly, the room is on the second floor of the building, which isn't really a big deal, but if you're someone who has difficulty with stairs (there's no elevator), then that's something you should know.

All in all, I thought this was a great value-for-money location, and I found it incredible convenient to get around town during my visit in Singapore. Highly recommended!"
"It was a fantastic place to stay - very convenient, clean, had a pool and a gym and super nice people living in the building. Even the Security Guards and the building staff were great! I stayed there for 2 months with my cute little dog and we were very happy. Team Jay were very responsive and helped us whenever we asked for anything. One of the best Air BnB experiences ever! Thank you Team Jay for making our stay in Singapore so good x"
"The place is conveniently located which is easily accessible by Somerset MRT with many shops, restaurant and supermarkets nerby. The host was quick to respond to our requests. It was overall a pleasant stay at Jay__ place."
"We've extended our stay at Jay's place and it has served the needs of our family very well including full-size kitchen, balcony, swimming pool and many amenities nearby. The host was was very responsive & friendly. This made our stay a pleasant experience. Thank you Team Jay!"
"Jay__ place exceeded our expectation in all way possible. It__ close to Novena MRT, very clean, bright and spacious. On top of that, Jay, Tingfu and their team are very responsive ... do their best to make our stay a pleasant one. We truly loved staying at their place and would recommend it to everyone else."
Excellent host . Good convenient location . Everything is in walking distance .
Nice place! Would stay there again
"Upon check in I was thoroughly disgusted with the state of the apartment. 

Underwear from previous tenant under bath matt, urine on toilet seats, dirty floors, kitchen covered in grease, and a garbage bag for a curtain on the balcony window just to name a few.
This was the dirtiest air bnb we had ever checked into. 

Additionally, we arrived late in the evening and the cot for my child was completely unsafe- the mattress was too big for the cot, making it slope which is completely unsafe for any child. There was also not a clothes dryer on site as promised in the description.

However, the host did rectify these challenges. They were extremely responsive for the rest of the stay. They apartment was cleaned thoroughly, a brand new cot was purchased for my son, mattress toppers for very uncomfortable beds and
kitchen necessities were purchased  as
well as regular cleaners were facilitated. I did appreciate these efforts but expected more from a super host at check in. Especially because I had communicated I was pregnant and bringing home a newborn during my stay in advance of my checkin.

Great location for medical tourism!"
"Strategic location, groceries is a about 10min walk & there are 2 malls a few bus stops away. A little hiccup during check in, seems like the agent didn__ have the keys... other than that everything else was great. I had a toddler so the availability of baby chair, baby tub was really convenient. Thanks!"
Good tourism location.
"Clean room,shower,toilet

"Quick trip. Place to sleep.
 Bad for allergies. Hair everywhere. Not my cup of tea but I would recommend for a 1 or 2 night stay"
Very good and affordable place.
Very nice and clean place.
"Thanks for providing a clean and complete function apartment for our family to stay for 3 days.    At first, we were warmed by a few taxi drivers that it is a special business zone  and being alerted to walk alone if you are a single lady."
Nice place and good location
Nice spacious flat in a great area. Quite close to MRT. Definitely recommend.
"An excellent location, very close to MRT Kallang which is 15min walk from the apartment. Reasonable price, especially if you__e with family!"
Thank you for the quick processing my refund.
"Alex's place is clean, is in a very good and convenient location, and has all the general amenities that one would look for in an Airbnb apartment. Most of all, Alex is an extemely responsive and fulfills any needs that one might have immediately and without hesitation. Would highly recommend the place to anyone and would love to stay here if we come again . Thanks Alex!"
They coordinated with us very well
"Steve__ house is truly amazing, everyone in our group loved it. It is a newly renovated home with beautiful furniture in all rooms and state of the art appliances. We all recommend this home and give it two thumbs up!"
Excellent (WOW!!!!) house and superb host. The best house I have stayed in Airbnb. The best host ever. Will look forward to staying here again.
"This is a very modern, spacious, and well-decorated clean house that surprised everyone in my group. The pictures post out are already good but it was even better than what__ shown in the pictures. 
The host was very sweet to make us feel like we are his friends rather than just guests. He replied fast and offered more than he should: sending Chinese New Year gift&greetings over, run to the supermarket to get what we needed only because I asked if they have one, etc. 
Definitely recommend this place - nice house, great host, excellent experience! Perfect for family/big group!"

"Difficult to Rank who is better , Host or House :).  Amazing Host , Always ready to Help. House, have not experienced anything better then this on Air B&B. Morden , Spacious, Newly renovated , Clean and with all the amenities you can think off. Would highly recommend Steve's place.  Will look Forward to stay in here again... Thumbs up. 

Negative : Ummm...... . Well you would not want to leave the house.. haha..
Was there anything really !!.  No :) . It was super fun with such a big group. Thumbs Up once again.  Cheers Steve."
"Excellent location, Steve was a good host which helped us navigate through Singapore. The house itself is a wow, everything is so clean and brand new, I__ really impressed. Amenities around the area was convenient as well, nothing much I can ask for."
"If you wanna have a spacious place to crash in Singapore, there is no better place than this. The apartment itself is well-furnished, artistic, and comfy. The neighborhood feels local and friendly with amazing food nearby. It__ just great. 

But the hosts are even better. Steve__ parents give us a warm welcome at 7:30am, following with a detailed house tour and show us around the street and all the good restaurants.

Later on, we accidentally left a jacket at the house after checkout, Steve__ sister send it back to our hotel at 11pm.

Great place, amazing hosts, you won__ regret it."

The house is superbly equipped with amenities and the kitchen is well-stocked. This spacious house easily accommodated our group of 10.

Our host was enthusiastic and responsive. He recommended many good restaurants with great food and value which we would never had been able to find as tourists, which was very helpful.

We enjoyed our stay very much and would certainly stay again if the opportunity arises."
What__ a great house! Very quick response! Highly recommend!
"The house is very spacious and clean, just a nice 3storey house for a big group or family. The 5BR are all attached to the bathroom except the other one at the ground floor. Nearby the bus stop to the south area, Eunos MRT station is a bit far but it's walkable. Richard welcomed us and responded our needs very quickly, thank you!"

"It's a amazing place to have your vacation stay . The host is a very friendly and approachable man which he will treat every customers as his own friend to the extends
that he will go extra mile to deliver what customer needs. The most magnificent thing is the toliet which is no doubts totally on Par with Marina bay sands hotel standard .People may worry about how clean is the place where it's a  5000sqft huge apartment but to my surprise cleanliness is always the most top priority for the host and it's 100% dust free...  To the future travellers,  it's worth every cents for this accommodation....."
"I made bookings for 16 guests, this place is like made for them. Super satisfied!! We will stay at Steve__ house when we visit Singapore again!!"
Very nice place to stay and feels like home
This is an amazing place! Kwan (Steve__ dad) gave us all the info we needed to check in easily. They are also very responsive whenever we had any questions. This place is so conducive for our big group to get together and we really appreciate the place. It was so clean and beautiful and spacious. We had everything that we needed. Everyone had a great experience.
The house description and images displayed are very detailed and reflect the actual. The property is situated in a calm and quiet area. MRT and bus stops are very close to this place.

"We loved our stay at this amazing property! Perfect for larger groups in a quaint neighbourhood. We were a party of 12 staying 3D/2N and looking for a spacious property that would not only accommodate us but also allow us to feel at home. Steve (along with his property manager, Richard) has put in all the finer touches, and hospitable details to make our stay exceed our expectations. Not only are the interiors clean, modern, functional and aesthetically pleasing,  there is a continuous thread of thoughtfulness throughout the experience, from check-in to check-out.  Situated in the lovely Katong area, we had access to great food, open park spaces and public transportation. Highly recommended, we will certainly be back!"
Clean. Comfortable. Spacious. Well equipped. Accommodating host. Good for big families.

"The house and host exceeded our expectations. Spacious and beautifully renovated. AC works nice and cold, and bathrooms are top notch (each room had a washroom). We were a group of 10 friends and were very comfortable staying here. Steve/Ken's dad Richard greeted us and showed us around his place. He went the extra mile to ensure that we had a good time and suggested us lots of places to check out in the area (hawker areas, where to buy groceries, etc). Thanks Richard, we had an amazing time!"
"This house worked really well for our family of 10 - and much more economical than a hotel. Lots of local restaurants etc.and good transport links to other parts of Singapore. House is spotless and has been renovated to a very high modern standard, with all the facilities you would expect"
Awesome place.  6 full bedrooms each with a connected bathroom.  Great experience.
Steve is very responsive and tried his best to give us a good experience. We had some minor hiccups but Steve resolved it quickly. It is a well furnished house and my family had a great time staying there.

We interacted with Steve's father, Kwan who welcomed us on our day of arrival and was there to see us off on our day of departure. The property itself is superb. The bedrooms are spacious. All modern amenities have been provided like oven, dishwasher, rice cooker, etc. 3 bikes were also provided so that we could get groceries from the shop nearby. The entire stay was really enjoyable and everyone had fun visiting the attractions at Singapore. I would most surely be staying at this property on my next trip to Singapore!"
i recommended this place for travelers who come to singapore especially in the east cost area.
"We have been in Singapore to participate at the exhibition with our team of 6 ppl. When arriving in Singapore, Steve and his dad made our stay outstanding. From coordinating the pick-up of the team and supporting the arrival until the days we spent there. The location is fantastic and I would recommend this house without any doubt to anyone who wants to come with a larger group to Singapore. It is a little gem in Singapore. The house is in perfect condition and it is a pleasure to spend the time there. Unfortunately we had not so much time to enjoy all the amenities.  And if you come for work there, you will value the 1GB network bandwith, with Wifi in all rooms. That enabled our team to work remotely from home and even fast than from Germany.

All in all, the stay was over our expectations. And I will definitely book my team inside this property again. Not only for the property with all comfortable details, but also for Steve and his fantastic dad, who make the stay convenient and an adventure you will not forget. Thanks for all! Martin & Team"
"Very nice place, good location, perfect for big group"
"The host is very nice and house is clean and modern,and in a good location.We had a great time here."
"This is a wonderful home with private facilities for all so ideal for a group of friends or family as there is enough space to have your own privacy when required. 
Nice location and easy to travel around Singapore from here 
Richard is a superb host offering great back up support and always available to offer advice on Singapore"
"The host took his time to welcome us and ensure we settled in well, going as far as to give us information on Singapore and advising on how we can get around and settle in better. The house is gorgeous, beautifully  furnished and clean. It added a pleasant element to our stay in Singapore."
Great big mansion with plenty of rooms for big family. All rooms are as good as master bedroom
"We rent houses on Airbnb a couple times a year and so far Richard is the best host.  He is  a very courteous, gracious and kind hearted gentleman.

"Shu__ boho loft is a special Airbnb experience - a smart, sophisticated space in a gorgeous, carefully restored original shop house. Excellent communication with great recommendations for local places. You must try the CSHH coffee bar. 
Great choice for a more local experience in very chic surroundings"
Highly recommended place
"It__ been a lovely place to stay, near to city center and train station. Very clean and comfortable. There is not lift, you have to take up the luggage with the stairs. I will surely recommend this apartment"
This unit is spacious and exactly as pictured. We loved stay in little India which was walking distance to a lot of other areas. The unit was very clean and we loved staying here.
"We loved our stay at Shu__ beautiful Shophouse. Beautiful, relaxing, clean accommodations and very easy to walk to lots or access MRT transportation. There were other guests in the shophouse but we rarely saw anyone and noise was not an issue. We stayed 1 night at Marina Bay to experience that area and are so glad we rounded out our trip with time at Shu__. Take advantage of her great recs for neighborhood food and drink!"
A great location to see the real Singapore - so many nearby places to eat. Easy to access the MRT and it__ such an efficient way to travel around (fast and cheap). The accommodation looks beautiful from the outside and is true to the pictures both inside and out.
"Great room, very good.very classy, tip: you need to share an entry lane, only communal areas have washing machines. Thanks for the host.it was a happy trip."
"100% highly recommended!
Everything is awesome!
As what is described!
Will definitely come back!"
"It is a beautiful and spacious place with a stylish touch. If you are looking for a space for relaxation and a experience for inspiration - you would love living in this shophouse as much as I did! The living room, kitchen, bathroom and bedroom are all well equipped and again, they are all very beautiful!! It was so good to come __ome_ every night and to enjoy a bath in the high ceiling bathroom. There are heaps of great cafes, hawker centres and shopping malls around. Easy access to pretty much anywhere! Shu provided a list of useful tips and recommendations which was helpful. Thanks for your hospitality!!"
"Perfect! I stayed in the Boho corner room on the first floor for 4 nights recently and I wish it could have been longer. I love Singapore and all that it offers and this Air BnB certainly lets you live like a local. 

Aside from the exceptional beauty of the renovated shophouse and the accomodation within, you are located near to some of Singapore's more characterful streets. This includes the world famous Mustafa Centre (24hr shoppers paradise for absolutely anything you can think of) to Little India and Serangoon Road. Of course there are a multitude of hawker centres nearby for the Singapore food fix and you can swim it out at the Jalan Besar Swimming Centre to keep fit - only 5 mins walk away. Near to there you will also find some really cool new pubs and cafes.

I loved every minute at Shu's place - and was even lucky enough to meet her in person as she was giving a VIP tour. Lastly, the service from Shu and her colleagues was first rate. I mistakingly tried to check in at the wrong shopfront and sent out a cry for help in the wee hours of the morning. Shu was kind enough to resuce me from myself and steer me in the right direction. Great job! Don't hesitate. Book at Shu's classic shopfront. You will not regret it."
The shophouse was very clean and spacious. Located in a very central location walking distance to 2 MRT stations and excellent restaurants. Highly recommended!
"Lovely apartment, comfy bed, good location.  Communication with Dolly & Shu was great both very responsive."
Fantastic place. Nice amount of space and everything you might need. Great tips to eat in the area and a good bed.
"Great little place located within walking distance of city square mall and subway station. The property manager Dolly was amazing and super helpful!
Tip for future guests: to use the key pad put your palm over it before trying to enter the code."

"A great airbnb with thoughtful decorations, definitely a good place to stay in Singapore."
"Gorgeous place! The bed is so comfy to sleep in, and the place was nice and airy! Great for a getaway in the city!"
"Shu's place is very well maintained and despite being located in a bustling neighbourhood, we got the peace and serenity we wanted in the night. It was a very cosy space and we really enjoyed our stay. Despite facing problems during our stay, Dolly was quick in her response and she immediately settled the matter for us even on a Sunday morning; what better service! Already looking forward to check out the other spaces Shu has to offer. Thank you!"
A stylish home that was also super comfy. Very easy to get around and local area was great. Highly recommend.
The place was as expected and very clean. But the host was extremely not responsive and didn__ reply to emails or Airbnb messages for our entire stay.
"We had a really good time. However, two sofa beds are quite short."
"Stylish, spacious and enjoyable place. Easy communication with host. Great location - close to many options to keep kids busy. Loved it. 

My 2 yr old son locked himself in the bathroom within 2 mins of arriving - host came around to help, but, didn't have the key to unlock the door from outside - luckily my son unlocked it after some very stressful 10mins - host is looking at changing the locks to avoid this in future. 

Tips provided by host was great - good food."
"Awesome place to stay. Great location, very clean, large and comfortable. Shu was great with communication. What more could you want?"
"This place is exactly what is listed on the app and it__ incredibly comfortable, clean and very spacious. Would encourage everyone to look into this place"
"Great to stay in a place with character and history in a modern city.
Shu (the host) sent extremely useful info and the whole stay was seamless!
Perfect spot for our stay in Singapore."
"Appartamento grande, spazioso e ricco di comfort. Stazione della metro a poche centinaia di metri, nei pressi di un buon centro commerciale e di un ospedale (linea viola) ed un'altra poco piÃ¹ distante (linea blu). Zona molto tranquilla con alcuni 24/7 nelle vicinanze.
Ci Ã© stata offerta la possibilit_ di lasciare i nostri bagagli nella zona comune prima del check in e dopo il check out."
"Absolutely wonderful place to stay,
Clean, modern & stylish apartment.
Good location, helpful  & thoughtful host and staff.
Will recommend to friends or anyone coming to visit Singapore."
"Well decorated and spacious apartment, great tips from Shu, clean and quiet. A great place to stay if you want to feel a bit more at home during your time in Singapore."
"Shu_ place is exactly as per advertised; stylish apartment in a great location.  The local  recommendations were a great help, especially in an unfamiliar City.   Great communication from the moment we booked,  with clear and detailed instructions.  Would thoroughly recommend Shu_ apartment."
Shu's place was great. Clean and spacious with just the right amount of info on the home and suggested local haunts. The check in/key pickup process made it super easy to let ourselves in late at night straight from the airport without disturbing anyone.
"This place is fantastic. Amazing location, beautiful, clean and comfortable apartment. I__l definitely be back."
"What a wonderful atmospheric apartment. Who would want to stay in a sterile hotel when you can stay here. Stylish, clean, comfortable and in a great location of Little India. Do go to some of the food markets and restaurants as recommended some of the food markets as  recommended by Shu. The MRt is near by but we enjoyed the buses.. to make it easier use the Citymapper app. We highly recommend this apartment"
"Well decorated, spacious and very comfortable apt in the quiet neighborhood, helpful and thoughtful staff and the host. Highly recommended!"
Great venue nicely arranged
"Shu__ ace was great! Didn__ expect it to be very clean, however there was some dusty corner in the bedroom. Too many decorative pillows I suppose. But other than thay, everything was awesome. The bathroom was spacious, living & kitchen area were stylish & quite wide. Finding the airbnb was easy, access into the place was a bit tricky, took a few minutes to figure out the electric door access."
"Stylish space. Very comfortable bed with silky sheets. Great location, in the middle of the action yet peaceful at night. Good WiFi and Netflix connection. Would definitely recommend."
Beautiful building convenient location. Batteries dead on tv remote so we bought new ones.
"There are various pros and cons of this place
Pros
- Beautiful and clean places
- Good location, it's near Farrer Park MRT station with ~5minutes walking you can easily find food around the shophouse
- The bed is very soft and very comfortable
- Have a surprise christmas gift ! so sweet :-)
Cons
- Our bathroom isn't really clean and couldn't use warm water in our bathtub
- Slow wifi connection
- Slow respond from the staff
- No slipper provided as promised"
Great place!
The place was beautiful. Worth it. Loved our time there
"perfekte lage (nahe mrt, einkaufszentren und diversen imbissen & restaurants), tolle einrichtung und schÃ¶ne architektur. wir waren als familie mit drei kids zu gast, fÃ¼r uns hat's tiptop gepasst."
"Very bad experience with the staff

We cannot judge the apartment because our flight to Singapour was cancelled. So our experience was only Â«_communication_Â»

NO ANSWER at all since the beginning (automatic post after our reservation) to the end of theoretical reservation. We sent a lot of messages and emails and tried to call the given phone number. Nobody...
Fortunately we were not there because in case you have an issue...well dont try to have the staff, they won__ answer... 
Think its very bad and risky.."
Great Airbnb in good location near Little India. Felt very safe walking around this area and MRT metro station approx 5 minutes walk away.
Great host! Easy arrangements and absolutely beautiful rooms!
Good!
The place is as beautiful as the pictures. Just 5 mins away from city square mall as well as a 24 hour mini mart. Abit of issue with the place being dusty but all in all a wonderful stay.
"It__ really nice!!
Stylish and clean and good location to travel"
The place instantly wow-ed me upon stepping in and my partner couldn't stop gushing about how gorgeous it is! Had a great memorable time spending 2 nights here.
"Awesome place to chill and hangout. I managed to surprise my best friend.  

Had an awesome time "
"Great house, great location. Under 5mins walk to city square mall, very convenient. Our host, Shu is very responsive and friendly. The ultimate boho stay, everything is so pretty! Highly recommended. Can't wait to try the other stays by Shu."
Beautiful place with good amenities. House manager wasn__ very responsive to our messages but everything else was good! Convenient and comfy place.
"Well located near subway 200m, easy walk. Food everywhere, endless options, really easy. 

Room is cozy, good Aircon with Singapore hot weather.

Joey team is fast to respond to my qns and everything went well despite no physical handover, self checkin. :)"
Disappointed in my stay. Host did not communicate the airbnb change until 2 days before check in. The location changed was very far from original and unit is very small for a family of 4 adult and 2 children. Recommend traveller to check closely with host as he will ask you to wait for his management team to contact you when close to the stay.
"_¿ä_å¾___,_¿æ_ç¬¦å_é¢__"
"The stay at Aaron__ with my friends was very pleasant! His place is clean, very convenient as it is near central, and he always helps us out with our needs. Aaron__ responses to our queries and messages are very prompt. It was a delight staying at his place and we appreciate that he is always very accommodating with our requests. Would definitely choose to stay at Aaron__ again in future."
"Joey__ place is very convenient and got easy access to public transport and have few eating place across the block and also just one step away to hypermarket. It is also nearby to the mall, about 3 bus station away. Joey and her helper is very friendly and helpful to me. My one-month-stay in Singapore feels like at my home."
Would recommend Joey's place any day. Place is as defined Cozy and comfortable. She and her two kids are the best part of the home though. I fell I'll during the trip and she was so supportive and sweet to help me out for me to get better. The place is located at a good location with easy access to all the amenities. Would love to come back and stay.
"Thanks a lot Joey, you were an amazing host. My stay was very comfortable and Joey helped me with everything...she is a very prompt host and always there to help....i would surely recommend the place to everyone."
"Was at Joes's place for my training at Seletar Airport. Her place is quiet, good for those studying and very accessible to almost all."

"it's a wonderful experience, thank Joey for her hospitality"
Great Apartment with great host
"Comfort place to stay, strategic for family and group, fast response and helpful owner, good for privacy, over all very satisfied.. Thx.."
Great place
"Alex's place is amazing! A block away from local shops and eateries, location is sooo convenient! Also, a private bathroom for each room... so unheard of! Our family felt home. The private parking spot was a plus!  Thank you, Alex and Kevin for hosting us!"
Nice apartment with lot of rooms and bed. Check in was awesome and super easy. The apartment was clean too
This is a good place considering the features of the unit (3 baths/toilets in each 3 rooms) at an affordable price and if you want to stay near the top tourist places to be visited.  Although the location is not conducive for girls or a family with minor children.
My stay here was great. Aircon was not cold but host was quick to send in technical support to get it rectified. The elevator could not carry heavy load so have to make a few trips back and forth to bring all our luaggage. Nonetheless a great host and nice place.
"Overall it was fine!Host texted me that location changed saying it was an upgrade yet it__ the same or may be a bit worse than as shown in photos!Host was difficult to contact!There was no housekeeping  although we had to pay housekeeping fees at booking!But comparing the amount paid with the service we get ,it was fine I would say !!"
"You can request family in one room.
With this price you can had all day breads, clean room.
We also can buy all entrances tickets with cheaper prices from Happysnail__."
"Stylish, spacious and quiet apartments located in a fun part of town. Shu is a very responsive host."
"We stayed for a week in Shu's Shophouse and loved it.  The room had every amenity needed and was exactly as advertised.  It was very clean, organized and comfortable.  The check in/out process couldn't have been easier.  Dolly, the house manager was very responsive, as was Shu with all communications.  Shu also provided recommendations for food options in the neighborhood and she was spot on with all of them.  We tried several of her recommendations and along with other great food in Hawker Centers, made the trip.  We highly recommend a stay in the Shophouse and would gladly stay again if we make it back to Singapore."
"All in all, a great place to stay if you want a quiet getaway. Could work further on pillows and linens cleanliness as well as airing the rooms before the next traveler checks in. There was a foul stench when we checked into the room. Other than that, pictures and amenities are as per what is documented and referenced when booking."
My in-laws loved this room! They weren__ feeling well during the trip and were able to be well rested while staying in this room.
"I have stayed at three of Shue__ places and they are all wonderful. Great location, clean, very cool and some great eating and shopping tips. It really is my home away from home in Singapore."

Shu__ place is great! Thoughtfully designed and appointed. A great base in little India! Thank you Shu 
I've stayed at other locations managed by this host and had a great stay.  This venue was no exception. Will use again when in Singapore!
"We had a fantastic stay in Singapore at Shu__ beautiful apartment. Check in and check out were super easy and Shu herself was very responsive, allowing us to leave our bags before and after our stay. The apartment itself is gorgeous, very clean and has everything you would need. Location is good, if you love a walk, everything you want to see is approx 40 mins away. Otherwise it__ a short train ride from either of the stations close by. Would definitely recommend!"
"Nice place with everything needed. Building was being renovated, but that didn__ pose any inconvenience."
"Shu__ place was great! I would definitely recommend it, just like the listing "
"My 2nd time in this place and it__ in a newer shophouse. Newer is better :)
Nothing short of a great stay!"
Great design throughout the studio and common area. Simple and stylish. Highly recommend for those who are design addicts!

An amazing space. Will definitely be back!
Lovely spot for exploring Singapore. Great location and Shu was the perfect host sharing tips and checking in throughout the booking process
"Eine tolle MÃ¶glichkeit in Singapur zu wohnen. Die Appartements sind in einem toll restaurierten alten Haus. Es gibt mehrere Wohneinheiten in dem Haus, die kurz aber auch mittelfristig vermietet werden. Unsere Wohnung war sehr stylisch und wir haben uns in dem Ambiente super wohl gefÃ¼hlt.  Die Lage ist gut, nicht weit zu Bus- und U-Bahnstationen, SupermÃ¤rkten und kleinen Restaurants. Wenn wir das nÃ¤chste Mal in Singapur sind, werden wir sicher wieder hier wohnen!"
"The room is okay, but the host wasn__ very responsive"
Good
Pleasant accommodation experience will choose again in the future
"Great location and gorgeous building. Just round the corner are lots of great cafes and bars, including Chye Seng Huat Hardware, amazing cafe with great coffee and food. Super helpful and responsive hosts."
Shu and Dolly were very friendly and reliable. Dolly always texted back immediately and answered all of our questions. Check in and check out was working fine. The flat is clean and is provided with everything you need. Location of flat was great!
A great place to stay in Singapore. Only a short walk to many train stops and it was super comfortable inside. I would stay there again.
"Check in process was a little confusing, mostly because I didn__ understand the layout of the building. I did not realize this was basically a home (living room and kitchen downstairs) with bedrooms rented out or else I wouldn__ have picked it for my family. It ended up being stressful with my toddler. He wasn__ feeling good our first few nights so he literally screamed nonstop which I__ sure was annoying to other guests (sorry!!) and extremely stressful for us. There was about a 2inch gap under the door so I__ sure the whole place heard him. One night we returned from a night out and new guest had arrived. They had their stuff spread out the common area and they were all hanging out. They were extremely confused when we walked in and we had to convince them to let us in and that we were staying there too. I realized I wasn__ crazy in my misunderstanding of the listing as we obviously weren__ the only ones confused. 

Bathroom could have been cleaner but the room and rest of the house were clean. Bed was very comfortable! It was nice being able to watch Netflix, especially with a little one around.

We enjoyed the mall and playground close by."
"Shu's shophouse is beautiful on the inside and out. It was a delightful experience to stay there, and she also provided great tips for food in the area."
"ä¸___å¸¸ä____¸æ_,ä½_½®å¾__ä¾,ä¹¾æ·¨,____¦çµ¦___ï½"
"Very stylish room with en suite bathroom in guesthouse, shared kitchen and laundry (but kitchenette in the room). Good location, great food recommendations. It smelled damp when we were there but that might be unavoidable in a period house in a tropical climate. Shu was very easy to communicate with."
It__ a great place if you__e looking for an accommodation in the central part of Singapore. You also get to experience living in a modernised shophouse.
Stylish and comfortable home
"Shu's place was great! Very clean, great amenities and in a great location. Shu and her house keeper were very attentive and communicated quickly. Lots of great tips for around Singapore as well! I would recommend this for anyone traveling to Singapore."
Easy MRT access and grocery facilities at an amazing shophouse . Will highly recommend .
"We went as a family of three, two adults and a toddler. 

This could not have been a better location as a family. There is a park across the street, and an ecomall with a large playground down the block. We did not need a Grab the entire stay, as we walked everywhere. Little India was such a treat, with flavorful and well priced food. 

Overall, we would definently come back. Shu's place is very well decorated, Dolly is very responsive (house manager), and the location was perfect."
"If you want a quiet neighborhood and stylish place to stay, then Shu's house is perfect for you.  I love the location.  Food choices are abundant within the area.  MRT and bus stops are also a few minutes walk.  The host is very responsive and check-in procedure is a breeze.  I had a lovely stay in Singapore."
Everything was great. Thank you Shu!
"The tropical apartment is lovely. Lots of wardrobe space, good shower and very stylish. Only thing is you can__ see outside to see what the weather is. Feels a little claustrophobic. But was still a lovely stay as I didn__ stay in the room much - just to sleep."
"Nice and clean , but the blanket and bathroom have bad smell. I had a headache because of smell. And wifi password is not matched, i asked that to shu, but she didn't answer it."
"Great shophouse experience with a beautiful interior!  Location was close to many great foods and Shu__ guide was an excellent reference point!   Central to all the main sights to see, no better way to experience SG using this as home base!"
"The Shophouse is amazing. Every corner is a treat to the eye, from the outside timeless facade to the lobby__ interior touches and the room__ elegance. I can__ think of anything bad to say about this place. I would definitelt book here again next time I come back in SG. Shu is also a great host. Very highly recommended."
"Very nice small loft 10mins walk from the metro station. Everything you need, stylish furniture. Overall very nice stay."
"å¹²å__¹ä¾¿ç¾_,_____è§_½¡"
"Space was clean and supplied with basic necessities. Not a lot of restaurants nearby, which was fine with us because we enjoyed walking. Safe area, park nearby"
Shu's place is stylish and clean! Highly recommend it if you're staying longer than 3 days. Shu is very accomodating and understanding - check this place out.
"This is a great place, easy and convenient. 
We stated in the Loft. It was not as traditional as I hoped and felt the photos were a little misleading . 
Shu and Dolly are responsive and professional to deal with."
The apartment is very conveniently located with a shopping mall and train station  close by
"Beautiful, clean, just like in the photos."
Good host
"Wonderfully maintain loft, with vintage furnishings. highly recommended and i would love to stay at this property again"
"A cosy, homey and absolutely clean abode, in a lovely area! The ambience is quiet and calm, so relaxing! Shu is a super host! I am certain to be back again _¤ï__¤ï_"
"Good place, very quiet place, love the ambience"
"Unique and well designed place. Really loved living in the boutique shop house as it almost felt like traveling to another country! Friendly host who provided thorough instructions, and seamless check in."
"Amazing place, atmosphere and also definitely great host! Thank you!"
Charming little place in a well decorated shophouse. Loved the atmosphere
Shu has a nice joint. Worth checking out for both locals and travellers. 
Lovely place for quiet getaway.
"Amazing loft, so cozy and comfortable "
As promise it is indeed a cozy loft with amazing interior
Amazing place and host!
Very quiet apartment with very aesthetically pleasing common and private space
Very cosy n stylish place
"Wonderful stay, beautiful decor, will definitely recommend!"
"Interesting concept, beautiful space in a hip area"
Great place with individual concept rooms that will suit your taste!
"Very nice & chic space, perfect for 1-2 pax. Very comfortable, there__ Netflix.. Overall a very good stay and I__l definitely book again!"
The room is just as it is in the pictures. Quiet room in a beautiful heritage shophouse was just what i needed to recharge. City Square mall and the famous 24 hour Mustafa store just 5-10 minutes walk away. Would love to stay again in the future.
It was perfect. I loved everything about this place. Very organization & extremely clean. I would def be coming back
Really clean and comes with Netflix to chill and the bed is really comfortable!
Host is very responsive and kind and does the extra mile to make your stay great definitely recommended
"This shophouse apartment is a very cute and unique place to stay while in Singapore. It is centrally located and just steps away from some really great food (I especially recommend checking out Swee Choon for great dim sum)! I would recommend this place for couples or VERY close friends, as the shower is pretty much IN the kitchen and so it__ hard to have too much modesty while you__e getting in and out of the shower. It might not be suitable for casual acquaintances staying together. 

The bed is also very comfortable - it looks lumpy at first, but is actually quite nice. 

I will mention that I had a bit of trouble sleeping in past 7 or 8 (after a late night) because the morning light filters in through the stained glass windows (which are beautiful, don__ get me wrong). Dolly provided us with some extra blankets (which we turned into a blanket curtain), but if you are a delicate flower like me, I would bring along a sleeping mask if you are sensitive to light. 

Overall, we loved staying in this unique space and appreciated all of Shu__ recommendations!"
The shophouse is absolutely gorgeous in a very convenient location. The room itself is well-decorated with stylish furniture. I would definitely come back to stay in any of Shu__ places!
"Shu__ place is exactly how it__ shown on pictures, incredibly clean and stylish. The communication was great and any problems/issues were immediately sorted. Before our stay Shu very kindly sent a list of local recommendations and was a great host. Would definitely recommend this flat to anyone looking to explore Singapore."
"Great location, superb accommodation. I enjoyed my four days stay at Shu__ property."
Really felt like a home these 4 days in Singapore. A great place to stay. Communication and help from Shus was amazing! Recommended!
"It was so nice stay!!
Hope to stay here again when i come singapore in the future
Thank u!"
"Great host, great location, great communication all around :-)"
"I really really loved staying at Shu__ place. It__ so beautiful and thoughtfully our together. The bed is  SO comfy I slept like a dream. The location is great,  convenient to everything yet you__l feel like a local instead of a tourist. Listen to her restaurant recommendations, they are all so tasty."
Great location
"This property was located in a stunning colonial building, the apartment itself was beautifully decorated and the bed was very cosy. The shower was powerful with hot water. A cool thing I personally liked was that  you could watch tv from the shower! / from the toilet with a clever use of mirrors! (you can also draw the blinds if you want privacy whilst using the bathroom) / the property is situated in a hip neighbourhood of jelan besar - I recommend two bakers / black fairy coffee / the tiramisu house for breakfast. There so many good eateries around and it__ so close to the metro, so easily accessible to other parts of the city. If you__e into yoga there__ a yoga studio a few doors down. Also a wonderful lady called Dolly lives a couple of doors away and can help out with questions / check in. All in all a perfect stay, I couldn__ recommend Shu__ place enough!"
"I enjoyed very much staying at the Straits Suite in 1920s Shophouse. It is the perfect place to stay: Nice decoration, perfect cleanliness, all the available equipments as well as the very convenient location."
"Shu__ place was very clean, quiet, seamless access, and close to everything. Her house keeper Dolly was always very helpful. I hope to stay there again on upcoming visits to Singapore."
Our stay at Shophouse was perfect! The apartment is really nice and just as pictured. There are a lot of restaurants and malls close by. Little India is a busy area but very authentic. We definitely can recommend this Airbnb to other guests!
"Shu's property was stylish, well located and exactly as presented. We'd definitely stay again!"
"We loved staying in the shophouse _ clean, stylish, and a great location. Thanks so much for a seamless and comfortable Airbnb experience, Shu and Dolly!"
"I wanted to stay longer in this loft. So spacious, airy, stylish and comfortable.  Great location, easy in and out access. Loved the shared common space where I hung out for a bit before my late flight."
"Shu__  Shophouse was a great place to stay. It is convenient to transport, not too far from anywhere and well appointed. Would highly recommend staying here when visiting Singapore. We would certainly stay again!"
"Peaceful, heritage enclave near busy area with all you need in walking distance."
"This room is located in a very quiet neighbourhood with chill vibe, at the same time very good access to the city. It is bright and spacious. We enjoyed our stay very much."
"We had a great stay at the apartment, the host gave us a lot of information beforehand which made check in very easy. The apartment was stylish and modern with lots of light. The location was great, close enough to restaurants/ shopping malls/ mrt stations but hidden away so nice and quiet. The building itself is beautiful too. The only downside is the kitchen was abit lacking in amenities (toaster etc) but overall I would definitely recommend staying here if visiting Singapore."
"The shop house was exactly as described and we were more than happy with the amenities. 
Little extras like being able to leave our luggage in the common room before checking in was a big help as our aircraft arrived at 5 am. Also our departing flight was at 8pm and we left our luggage again in the common room till 4:30pm. These things really help when you are on holidays."
"A great space, in a great area."
"Shu's shophouse is a great flat in Singapore!  Her place is exactly as in the photos, and extremely spacious.  Easy check in/out, and quick communication made getting to the flat and settled in a breeze. Great food, coffee, and cafe options within walking distance, and lots of great recommendations from Shu as well.  Highly Recommended for a trip to Singapore!"

The aparments is beautifully appointed and full of character.  Very good location and local MRT station is close by together with a great shopping centre.  We loved our stay in this aparment - the shop house block is full of character and the airbnb to be recommended.
"A repeated booking is the sincerest form of commendation.  My earlier review happily still holds, and I look forward to staying at Shu's stylish, cozy and ultra convenient pied-_-terre during future trips."
Thank you for a beautiful stay Shu! Just loved it. Highly recommended.
"Shu's place - a hidden oasis of tranquility in the middle a bustling city, close to shops, train station and amazing eateries. Little India is a short walk away where you can have delicious vegetarian food at Komala Villa, and walk around the quarters and see some amazing street art. Check-in was smooth, and the apartment has all the amenities you could hope for (great shower after a long day). Communication with Shu before and after arrival was timely and pro-active. Thank you for making our stay in Singapore a pleasant one."
"I would highly recommend this AirBNB to anyone visiting Singapore. We felt it was a bit difficult to find a unique Airbnb in Singapore but this is definitely one of them. Great location, warm interior, perfect communication with Shu (and Dolly:) and spacious. 

Everything is exactly as advertised and the area is amazing. Great Indian food around the corner and public transport options are super close. (We actually walked most of the time)

Don__ hesitate , this is Airbnb is perfect."
"my second stay at one of shu's studios _ and equally satisfying! great same location close to farrer park mrt, thoughtfully furnished high-ceiling studio with plenty of space and a beautiful monochrome bathroom all made my stay very pleasant. can't recommend enough!"
This is the third room I have stayed in. All are delightful. They make staying in Singapore memorable and unique.
Very nice.
"I stayed here for a short trip with my husband and it was perfect! We'd traveled to Singapore before and had a difficult time finding a great hotel without spending a fortune. When I found this listing I honestly thought it was too good to be true. The photos were beautiful, the history of the shophouse was so interesting, and the price was beyond competitive. Turns out, it is a gem I'm so grateful to have discovered. We could easily walk to the mall and metro, She gave us great recommendations for our trip, and the room provided enough space and amenities for us to relax after a full day of exploring. From now on, this is the only place we'll be staying in Singapore. Our plan is to try to stay in every room, each seems decorated uniquely with it's own flair. Highly recommend!"
Beautiful space and great location! I highly recommend staying at Shu__ place. I want to come back!
"Very cute Airbnb spot, would stay in this or one of the other suites in the building again "
What a great place! Amazing apartment in a unique set of shop houses in what has to be the best local food area of Singapore! Everything was perfect. Highly recommended. Will definitely stay again next time in town.
Very nice and clean little apartment in a very quiet location not far from the city center. The communication was great. Thank you.
"This place was comfortable, good aircon, great location and great price.  The hosts were helpful and everything was nice and easy. Would stay again."
Great location (so close to yummy places)! Bed was very comfortable and overall the suite was excellent for 2 people staying for a few days.
"Great place, very central to CBD and Little India and close to public transport."
Great space and value!
"Shu__ place is super amazing, with a location, modern interior design and clean interspace. Definitely will recommend this lovely place to everyone;))"
We had such a great experience at Shu__ place. The room was perfect and the guides were super helpful for exploring nearby!
Place has superb feeling of old and new theme. Plus it__ near a mall and mustafa which is really good for shopping! A must book place. We__l try other room when we get back.
"Great place to stay. As a first time visitor to Singapore, I found the accommodation centrally located; making my trip great! The room itself is well kept with stylish finishes!"
"Easy checkin/out, comfortable stay, and great local recommendations. Highly recommend!"
"Lovely studio apartment so close to shopping malls, markets, restaurants and MRT station. Spacious and private with lovely antique pieces mixed with modern convenience, a fantastic comfortable queen bed and large walk in shower. Easy check in/out. Very basic cooking utensils but full kitchen supplies in the common kitchen downstairs if you really want to cook... there are so many eateries close by theres is no need really."
"Beautiful space, great organisation"
We had an extremely pleasant stay. The area was quiet and really boasted an authentic rustic charm to the iconic shophouses of Singapore from the yesteryears. Highly recommended!
"This is hands down the best AirBnB I've stayed in, being an active user since (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) While I didn't get to interact with Shu while there, her responses were quick and helpful. Her recommendations were spot on for things to do, places to eat/drink. The suite is sparkling clean, very stylish (great for your (Hidden by Airbnb) !) and well laid out with a powerful air conditioner. After zipping around Singapore all day, it's a relief to come home to such a beautiful, well thought out space to rest and relax before hitting a night out on the town. I can't wait to be back and highly, highly recommend staying at Shu's place."
beautiful place with thoughtful amenities
"Beautiful and clean space. Toilet is bigger than picture. During night time there is a window on the right that can__ completely shut the street lights off so it does shine into the unit. For people who likes to sleep in complete darkness, just bring and eye shade. Place is perfect"
"Comfort or conducive, you can definitely find both at Shu's place. I'll definitely return and check out all her apartments! Thanks for the amazing abode :)"
Wonderful place
Really gorgeous space that__ private and perfect for a staycation too
"Very nice , cosy and stylish decoration on each individual rooms . Easy Check in and also convenient for people who is driving , ample of parking lots available. Location is very convenient too . Definitely will come back to stay . Best idea place for couple to enjoy their staycation ."
"We really enjoyed our stay at Shu's place. It's exactly as shown in the pictures, very nicely decorated and cosy. The TV with Netflix and kitchen space were really appreciated. Great location for food, many places are within walking distance and are open till late, perfect for supper! Near to public transport and supermarket as well. Shu herself is very warm and friendly, communication was seamless. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this place!"
This is a wonderful private space to disconnect from the rest of the world!
Great quiet place
The airbnb was a reprieve for us from the usual monotony of staying at home (due to covid) and felt like a real getaway. The peaceful setting and beautiful touches around the room were so thoughtful. We loved staying here and would come back again!
"Everything was amazing, check in was easy and convenient. Loved the touches in the rooms too! 

the location of the room was amazing, just few mins walk to mrt, and even mustafa centre. loved that it was accessible. 

Shu and the house manager were great too - they were v prompt at replying!"
"The aircon leaks sometimes. Also light from the streetlight comes in through the right window at night, mind be worthwhile getting some blinds.

Otherwise a great stay, really appreciated having the kitchen"
Lovely place and stunning home ! The environment is very chill ! And is walkable to so many food places and transport ! This will definitely not be our last stay .
"Enjoyed the place away from the city bustle! Really quiet for a staycay, thanks Shu and Dolly for the lovely place!"
Great place with super convenient location and lovely design!
"Good location, very nice interior, clean like own home and reasonable price."
"Rly enjoyed my stay. Extremely clean and stylish, just like how it is shown in the pictures. Lots of good food around the area as well. Will definitely come back again!"
Extremely enjoyed my stay here. Love  the interior so much!!!!!!! Posted a video on my IG and everyone started asking where is this place. Shu has been an amazing and polite host with her immediate replies to any of my queries. Location is perfect to many eateries nearby. Thank you Shu and Dolly.
"Overall, given the price of ~SGD450 for two nights, I would only give a 3 star as it is not cheap, without amenities and to note that unlikely most AirBnB overseas, this one does not provide many kitchen necessities - only VERY basic kitchen equipments were provided, no salt or pepper in the individual rooms and a few old packets of tea and coffee. 
Much would have been expected in the kitchen (such as a full stock kitchen) given the price. At least a good supply of tea or coffee, perhaps some thoughtful snacks etc would have been nice. After all, what is the difference between a hotel and BnB? Perhaps the kitchen and preparing your own meals. 
Place was not as clean as expected but communications were fast. The host was reactive and responded to our feedback. The place would benefit from a fresh coat of paint and a good clean up."
"MairÃ©ad is a wonderful host. Easy communication, absolutely reliable. The condo is a perfect place _ absolutely enjoyed staying there. Thanks again!"
"Mairead's place is an awesome place. the locality is superb. Her place was sparkling clean and is loaded with all the required amenities. Our family had stayed there for 10 days and its was totally superb experience. Most of the Singapore's attractions are close to this place. 
there are 3 7-elevens near to the place and bus stop is just outside and MRT station is just opposite of building. you can walk to Merlion from the place and can have a nice marina or gardens walk! 
Mairead is very quick in responding to the queries and helps as much as possible to guests. Also pricewise she doesn't charge cleaning services and also gives discount if you are going to stay for a longer duration.
Overall fully satisfied with the choice made."
"Excellent apartment in a perfect location - easily accessible by transport, the flat has everything you need, is clean, modern, the facilities are great (there__ a pool and a gym), and MairÃ©ad is a great host. She responds quickly and is very helpful. Highly recommend staying here."
everything was great! great location!

"Mairead__ place is at a very convenient location. The place is exactly the same as the photos, very comfy and cosy 
Highly recommend her place if you visit Singapore"
Amazing room in the center. Very tidy and cozy apartment. Mairead and Sheldon are very friendly and hospitable hosts.
good house and location
"MairÃ©ad's place is perfect for a weekend in Singapore. Exactly as advertised, great location for both airport and main attractions. Very accommodating hosts too. Highly recommend."
Convenient location: 5 minutes from Tanjong Pagar MRT. Everything clean and tidy. Hosts working all day so mostly free run of the appartment. Would stay again.
"Mairead is a nice and welcoming host for everyone. The appartment and the rooms are very clean. Beside you can ask her about everything in Singapore and she can give you really good recommendations about the city, series, ... etc.. The location is very central. The train stations are around 500m away. I can definitely recommend this apartment to everyone."
"The best airbnb I__e stayed at so far! The place really is clean and organized, making our stay at Singapore easy and effortless. The location couldn__ be any better; it__ close to 2 MRT stations and a bus stop. The only downside is that if you ever visit Singapore again, you wouldn__ find a better place and hosts. Mairead and Sheldon are very friendly and made our stay ever more pleasant and welcoming."
"you will meet a good house and a good landlord.äº¤é_¾¿_,è®¾æ_é½__,__å®__,_¿ä_å¾_!"
"The accommodation was very clean and nice. It was convenient to have a Laupasat street and an MRT station near the accommodation. Thanks to you, we had a very satisfying trip. There is a swimming pool in the villa, so if you take your swimsuit, you can use it! We didn't know and didn't take the swimsuit, so we couldn't use it. If you are looking for a clean and nice place in Singapore, I strongly recommend it :) !"
"The landlord was a beautiful blonde girl who helped me a lot, lived in this house in Singapore and had a very pleasant and romantic vacation with my boyfriend. Thank the landlord for his trust and help."
Great place with awesome location!
"LocalizaÃ§Ã£o excelente. Tem uma estaÃ§Ã£o do metrÃ´ muito perto. Cama, travesseiros, cobertor e lenÃ§Ã³is de Ã³tima qualidade. A hÃ³spede respondeu todas nossas dÃºvidas. Permitiu que fizÃ©ssemos check-in mais cedo. Usamos a mÃ¡quina de lavar e secar dela sem nenhum problema. O banheiro tem uma Ã³tima ducha e itens de banho de qualidade. O banheiro Ã© privativo, mas nÃ£o fica dentro do quarto, isso nÃ£o foi problema para nÃ³s. A internet Ã© boa. Nada a reclame, somente a agradecer."

"We had such a wonderful time staying at this place 

First of all, a very fantastic location situating in the downtown area which is very easy to travel to many attractions within a few stops both via MRT or Bus (bus stop is just right in front of the building.) some are within walking distance.

The room is very clean and fully equipped with everything you would need.

And of course, Mairead is one of the best host I ever met. She helped us a lot through check in, local tips and so on."
"Many thanks Mairead for the condo.  It was very clean and stylish.  Very good location, close to all attractions.  If we come to Singapore again, will choose Mairead's condo again)"
"MairÃ©ad__ place was perfect for our stay in Singapore! The location is ideal, being walking distance to marina bay, raffles and Chinatown, with MRT and bus stops also very close making all of Singapore easily accessible. The apartment itself is very modern and clean, as shown in the pictures. MairÃ©ad and Sheldon were lovely hosts being so friendly and generous. The pool in the building is also stunning. I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone!"
The room is clean and tidy. Mairead is kind and replied very quickly.  It is a good experience.
"Great place to stay in downtown Singapore! The apartment is very nice (good pool too!) and it's close to many food spots including Lau Pa Sat for cheap and delicious hawker food. MairÃ©ad was quick to communicate and we really didn't see her besides check in, so the space is pretty much yours!"
"Great hosts and quick to respond and help you get settled in when you arrive, location is perfect and can walk to most key nightspots in Singapore. The apartment is very clean and a whisper-quiet aircon in your room keeps it very comfy overnight.  The pool is great if you have time and the gym is there if you feel up to it - no need to look anywhere else - this is a great place to stay."
"Nice hosts, good communication"
Great location near transportation
We had a great stay at Mairead__ place.  The gym and pool are fantastic. The location is amazing.
"Modern, clean apartment in the heart of Singapore. Perfect place If travelling for business or leisure."
The apartment is very centrally located and you can reach easly everything by bus and train. Everything was perfect
"Amazing location serviced by both buses and MRT, maxwell food court 10 min walk, lau pasat food court 5 min walk. Bed was super comfy, had a private bathroom, great pools and a gym. AC worked really well and MairÃ©ad and her partner were lovely hosts. Couldn't recommend more. Thanks for a wonderful and relaxing stay."
"Great place, great location, great host. We will definitely come back soon."
"Host was very friendly and thoughtfully arranged the room for a stay. Its a great place and location to stay for those who wants to have meetings or business at near location of this listing. Very strategically located. Comfy Bed, had a good night rest"
MairÃ©ad__ condo is gorgeous and I couldn__ fault a thing. Would definitely stay again!
"MairÃ©ad__ apartment is beautifully furnished with high quality stuff. The room was perfect, air conditioned and a comfy bed with practically its own bathroom. Couldn__ ask for more!"
"Beautiful, modern, quiet, apartment with amazing pool and toiletries. Great location !!! Would highly recommend!!"
"Mein Freund und ich waren auf unsere Asienreise 4 NÃ¤chte bei MariÃ©d zu Gast. Sie ist sehr hilfsbereit und Ã¤u_erst freundlich. Der Check In war super. Wir konnten sogar etwas frÃ¼her einchecken. MariÃ©d antwortet super schnell bei Fragen. Die Wohnung ist wahnsinnig sauber und gut ausgestattet. Unsere beste Unterkunft auf der Reise. Wir waren die meiste Zeit alleine in der Wohnung. Die Anbindung ist sehr gut. Zur MRT sind es nur wenige Gehminuten. Wer gerne spazieren geht, kannn das Zentrum und den Gardens by the Bay ebenfalls gut zu Fu_ erreichen. Fitnessstudio und Pool kann mitgenutzt werden. Wir wÃ¼rden wieder kommen und kÃ¶nnen die Unterkunft wirklich 100% weiterempfehlen! Vielen Dank :)!"
"It was such a wonderful time staying at this condo with Mairead. First of all, it's an ideal location in the downtown area which is very easy to travel to many attractions within a few stops both via MRT or Bus (bus stop is just next to the building.) From here, it's easy to travel popular places in Singapore (shopping centre, food court, business building...)
Especially, the room is very clean, tidy and fully equipped with modern things you would need. I've never ever stay in any tidy house like this. 
And, Mairead is absolutelt one of the best & thoughful host I ever met. She helped us a lot through check in, local tips and so on."
"MairÃ©ad__ home is amazing! I visited alone for a short trip and it was perfect. The apartment was sparkling clean while still offering a comfortable, homey atmosphere. It is located in a central area making it easy to walk to places or hop on the metro. I also felt extremely safe in this building. MairÃ©ad and Stephen were very welcoming but not overbearing and quick to respond to questions. The pool and gym facilities were a nice addition to the place and MairÃ©ad also had plenty of cooking supplies and left room for me in the fridge. Lastly, they left lots of clean towels and touches like the coffee/tea/bathroom amenities were greatly appreciated. If I ever return to Singapore I would love to stay here again!"
"Fantastic apartment, really close to all the great tourist spots. Apartment complex has fantastic amenities as well. Great hosts."

Location was great - right within walking distance from the underground/subway station, and the airport's just about five minutes away. Amenities include a swimming pool and gym in a quiet and safe neighbourhood."
"Very nice host , we enjoyed the stay :-) !!"
The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
"Value for money. The greatest advantage is the location and proximity to main city areas via the nearby Lavendar MRT station. Groceries and 24*7 food place nearby. Rooms are a little small but overall if you are just looking to crash in night, then it is a sweet deal at the price !"
"This is located at chinatown prime location, apartment is on #31 and mrt is basement, very convenient. Plenty of buses also at the bus stop beside the complex, convenient points to many tourist destinations in singapore. All kinds of cheap delicious food is found here, the complex and the huge food court beside it. Several mac donalds nearby here also. Room was clean and nice by cleaner before we checkin. We don't get to see the owner but cleaner helped orientated after our self checkin. We have the bedroom private to us and a private access to the living room outside our bedroom which is lockable by key. Very spacious and comfortable in summary. Owner responded fast to our qns and everything was smooth. Recommended service and location. :)"
"Near to Lavender MRT, a lot of food nearby
Sparkling clean, convenient,  Bus and MRT can take me everywhere.
Worth it price"
The listing was exactly as described and pictured.  Host was very accommodating and communication was tip-top. Highly recommended!
A great place to stay for a short trip to Singapore. I loved how detailed the house manual was and how friendly the management was. I would definitely stay at this home again.

"This is a charming space in a perfect location with easy access to Little India and Farrer Park MRT. Most notably, the host__ communication was superb. The unit was as expected. It had great AC, was very private, and the bed was comfortable. The wet-style bathroom was sometimes a nuisance, but functional. Tip: fully read the main door, lock instructions before arriving."
Great place in a beautiful old shophouse. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling to Singapore.
"My third time at Shu__ place. So easy, stylish and love the location! Highly recommend!"
"Shu__ shophouse is sparking clean and perfectly decorated. Check-in was a breeze after a long day of travel and my room was comfortable and calming. The shophouse felt extremely safe and was so stylish. 

I loved absolutely loved my stay!"
"Firstly, Shu's communication was first rate, and replies were received very quickly. Closer to our stay, Shu sent us lots of directions for entry to the apartment and tips for local restaurants and places to go, which was fantastic.

Secondly, the apartment is great - very clean and looked the same as the pictures!! There is a dining area and separate couch to sit on, and the bed is quite comfortable for a good night of sleep after lots of waking around Singapore!!!! 

Finally, the location is great - only about 5 mins walk from Farrer Park MRT and also from quite a large shopping mall, which has lots of eating places too. We would recommend this place to someone who wants a comfortable stay in a very easy location."
Enjoyed our stay. Recommend!

Really stylish place and super convenient!  Highly recommended
Definitely would recommend to someone staying in Singapore! We walked to Bugis and Orchard street from here (we could be crazy for doing so) but we wanted to see all the local shops! Super clean and cute space...
Stylish apartment in charming  shop house in a quiet neighborhood away from the hustle and bustle yet very near to a MRT  station. I would return in a heartbeat.

Lovely stylish space in a great neighbourhood. Will definitely consider staying again!

We stayed at Shu__ apartment for a total of 2 nights. Shu always responded quickly and she was always ready to help if needed. She provided very detail information prior to our arrival. The apartment is tastefully decorated and very cosy. We were two friends staying in it and we found it to be a little on the smaller size but it worked as we didn__ spend much time in the apartment. The location is great with many things walking distance. We would recommend Shu__ apartment for your future trip to Singapore. Thank you Shu! :) Nadia & Sam
Great location and a beautiful place to call home for a few days. Conveniently close to the subway station.
"Shu's place is extraordinarily chic. The entire house's layout was very spacious, bright and airy, like in the description. The amenities were complete and thoughtful. We enjoyed our stay so much!"
Fantastic apartment in an incredible old building. The space is beautifully renovated and very comfortable. Just be aware that there__ a bit of road noise in this apartment and it__ next to the laundry area. But it is a bustling metropolis so you need to expect some bustle. There__ nothing the owners could do about this but if you__e very sensitive to noise book one of the upstairs rooms. Overall a wonderful experience. Will most  certainly stay again.
Definitely a unique stay and loved that Netflix is part of the deal :)
"Great place, good location, cool shophouse!"
Clean and pleasant decorations but back doors open straight onto lane so really not for use.
This place was absolutely incredible. We stayed at the Scandi Room which was perfect for us. The location was really good! It gave us a chance to visit Little India as well as get a glimpse of local life but __owntown_ and all the touristy locations are all just train rides away. Shu and Dolly got back to any questions we had very quickly and checking in and out was really smooth. Thank you for your beautiful home!
"Awesome location, cool space. Would stay here again if visiting Singapore."
Nice Place in a perfect location. Would definitely stay at Shus place again
quite a welcoming host.  he took care of our every need and helped us a lot.  You can go and enjoy your travels with peace of mind.
"Great central location, stylish and comfortable interior."
I__ a solo traveler from New York City in Singapore for the first time. Honestly my first impression of this Airbnb wasn__ great. The door was wide open and the common area was a mess as there was a repairman working with no heads up that this would be happening at check in.  Two great things about this place: laundry machine with detergent and cold cold air conditioning.  It__ stylishly furnished/decorated but  feels a little rough around the edges.  The location was fine- a little further walk than I thought it would be in the heat but very quick to get anywhere a tourist might want to be. You do hear some noise being on street level but that comes with the territory. Thanks for a good stay!  I would stay again
A clean and elegant place in a great location.
"This room is so perfect to me and my friend. We stay at the Scandi Room which has nice decoration- it is exactly with the picture. There are full furniture and equipment for cooking and washing the clothes. The location is really good, near Little India. Shu and Dolly got back to any questions we had very quickly and checking in and out was really smooth. Thank you for everything! Highly recommend."
"The talent and passion that went in the Shophouse Enclave is so apparent! So many beautiful spaces with delightful, creative touches! We enjoyed our stay in the Scandi Loft and found the location of the Shophouse to be ideal! You could eat at a different place thee times a day for weeks on end and never need to go to the same place twice. Plus, shopping and public transit abound!  There is so much to see and do in Singapore but you will find it hard to resist staying in an evening or two, taking a luxurious rain shower, and then having some take out while watching Netflix from your comfy bed!"
This place is amazing. It__ Super cosy and it__ Super near to the MRT and all the delights as well. Cleanliness and hospitality is top notch. Will definitely come back again!
"a cozy, beautiful, and good location house around little Indian area. Very easy to get MRT station and quiet in the night! super recommend!"
"At no stage did we have any hot water. If the shower control was pushed fully to the left we were able to have a cool/tepid shower only
The drainage from the shower was very poor. We had to use a towel to act as a barrage to prevent it flooding into the rest of the bathroom which made the floor very slippery and unsafe.
Cupboard doors were unsafe and 2 detached when attempting to open.
There was no welcome pack or information about the area.
Bedside lights would be welcome as the only lighting is very bright downlights and the exposed bulb above the table which are operated by wall switches."
Nice space to relax. Well decorated and helpful to have a washer and dryer. Lots of cute cafes in the area.
Place was clean and awesomely located near a station to easily reach most places.  Was surprisingly quieter than I was expecting for being right next to the street.  Also had a lot of places to eat located around it  Would stay here again.
great location and value.
"Great spot right beside little India, with large variety of restaurants and shopping, stylishly decorated, close to MRT, laundry big plus, very comfortable"
"Great location, close to little India ,"
"A great place to stay. Strategic location. Close to the crowd but not noisy at all. Access is also affordable. 

The check in and check out process is very easy.

The cleanliness of the place is very nice with adequate toiletries. Its just that there should be a barrier in the bathroom so that water does not widen to the toilet and door. This is very disturbing."
I__ always tentative about booking Airbnb__ and the space being true to the website. This was such an amazing stay. Everything exceeded our expectations and any issues were dealt with immediately. Very happy with our time here :)
"I stayed at the Scandi loft for a few nights while attending a friends_ wedding. Everything was clean, check in process was very simple, and I found it really easy to get around to other places from this point. (Farrer Park MRT station is super close by). Being on the ground floor, there is obviously some street noise, but that all adds to the ambience of this well styled place! 
Will definitely be back!"
"Wonderful location, near to many food places and to public transport. Decor was as per the pictures too"
"Shu's place is located close to two interesting parts of Singapore. Little India and Jalan Besar both of which have plenty of things to offer everyone. Shu's place is a beautiful 'shop-house' which have exquisitely glazed tile work on the outside. An oasis of small building shop-houses surrounded by the high-rise buildings. The apartment itself was everything that it promised to be. I loved the design of the living area which had nice antique pieces too. The room where I stayed, 'Scandi', had a door that could open to the side road. I was happy with the sunlight, greenery and the arrangements. It was perfect for my stay and I recommend it to others too especially if you are interested in design, architecture and local Singapore culture. Thanks, Shu for offering this thoughtfully designed place on Airbnb."
"I visit Singapore every year and wanted to explore other options for my trips as I often stay at hotels. These restored shophouses caught my eye. 

My elderly mum and I had a enjoyable short stay in the Scandi Loft, on the ground floor. My mum had a bad knee so isn't great with climbing stairs so this ground floor suite was ideal. 

Beautifully decorated, comfy bed and the kitchen is a good size. We didn't do any cooking but the convenience of having basics is appreciated. Check in was easy though it would have been better if there are two sets of keys supplied if you are travelling with others. 

Expect a little bit of noise from the street. I am a light sleeper so my first night didn't go too well but this was easily fixed with earplugs the second night. Do note that the shared kitchen and laundry is just outside this room and I was awaken to chattering at 6am which was a bit annoying since house rules stated to keep your voices down during the night and into the early morning. 

As noted by other guests, the water from he shower does flow into the rest of the bathroom. They have provided a rubber mat but you have to position it so it stops this overflow a bit better. Perhaps some extra bath mats could be supplied. 

Laundry access just didnt work out for me. It's little tricky as you can only use it within 11am and 7pm and we were out during those hours.

MRT is a short walk and can be easily accessed through City Square Mall. The mall has a lot of food options and you just explore Little India nearby. The iconic Mustafa shopping centre is great for bargains and textiles. I used to live in Singapore and hadn't been in years so it was nice to explore this side of town again. 

Will stay again but would like to check out some of the other suites as it's a lovely place to stay."
"Overall a great little apartment in a good location. The photos promise a larger apartment than it really is, but for a few nights it__ great. The apartment is located in an old shipbuilding so could do with a lick of paint etc. Shops etc in easy walking distance, so no problem on that front"
Great place to stay
Everything is amazing. My 3rd time having staycation here. I will come again!
"Stayed at the Scandi loft. Amazing space & decor from the spacious lobby to the room itself. 

If you want something different & do not want to stay in a hotel, then pick one of the various heritage shophouse home that Shu has to offer. 

The Scandi loft is located at the ground floor. While you can hear cars, people walking by outside, or other guests at the shared kitchen, I did not mind (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with Shu was smooth & fast. Checking in was simple and straightforward. No complains, wouldn__ mind coming back."
"A wonderful shop house that has clean and fantastically decorated rooms. 
Easy to check-in, great communication with owner."
Nice placr
Good place .
"Nice, imaginative place."
5 star â­__!!!
"Beautiful place 
Supper nice host _¤ï__¤ï_"
"We love the design and the theme of the loft we stayed in! Also, it has a great location. There are so many cafes with delicious food nearby and is close to a shopping mall and the MRT station. We will definitely be back to stay in the other lofts next time!"
Had wonderful time staying there ! Everything was great !_¤ï_
"Location is great. Close to 2 mrts (lavender and bendemeer) + several bus stops + a big hawkre place (Broadway). Also, the room is very comfortable, good aircon. With washer, dryer, iron for clothes. and host was very helpful in all my inquiries and request to extend. A+ experience."
It's at a nice location. Near Orchard road. Walking distance to Great world City (mall) and a few eateries nearby. Place is suitable for Couples. Stylish home!
"I had a splendid stay! and was so excited about the projector in the bedroom. because of them, i wanna get that projector at home too! heheh would definitely come again if i'm looking for a short staycay in the future "

"It's an old walk up so you can't expect much but l enjoyed my stay in Hillary's place overall.

- Hillary is a great host. Communication line is always open, self-check in process was super smooth.

- Location is excellent. Food, MRT, supermarket, cafe, gym&swimming pool etc, all in a short walking distance.

- Place is kept clean by a nice lady helper, and it's generally quiet. I didn't really see other tenants during my stay.

- There is a shared fridge, water boiler, and microwave for a small cooking needs. It helped me a lot actually."
Really convenient and got a big hawker centre nearby
Great
super cute place in a beautiful building. close to little india and mrt station
"Really nice and cozy apartment with modern decoration. There was everything in the kitchen except salt and pepper .We don__ use to put a lot of spices so for us it was ok. 
Great idea with Netflix! 
Located near Little India gave us a great start point to explore Singapore."
"Her reply is very fast. And she did her best to solve my complain.

location is around little india and downtown was close by grab, taxi"

"We enjoyed our stay at this unique shophouse very much. The apartment is nicely decorated, the bed was really comfortable (the sleeping sofa a bit less, but still ok!) and we found everything we needed in the kitchen. With the air-con the temperature was pleasant. 
There are lots of nice restaurants around (read Shus tipps!) and also a nice and not crowded public swimming pool just a three minute walk away. A shopping mall is just around the corner. 
We would stay here again."
"Very cozy and stylish Singpore shophouse. Nice location, very convenient to access MRT and shopping mall.  Shu and Dolly are responsive and helpful. Highly recommend."
"Design, style, comfort, attention to detail: the Shophouse has ist all. Thank you Shu, we will be back!"
"The house was great with the traditional and classic interior. The staff are always stand by with you, so you can figure out what you need whenever you want. The unexpected one is the room was located in 4th floor...yes it was very challenging to bring my heavy baggage up to my house. Except for this, everything was satisfying."

"TrÃ©s bel apartement, calme et relaxant"
Shu__ place is beautifully decorated and super spacious so great value for money compared to what you would get for the same price at a hotel. We enjoyed exploring the area and the foodie tips came in very handy. Check in and out was very easy and we had no problems accessing the apartment. Shu was really easy to get in touch with as well so that made it easy. Would definitely recommend if you want to stay in a bigger place somewhere quieter!
"The home is beautiful and exact to photos, it was a lovely duplex room in a shophouse comprised of several other airbnb units under the same roof. Nicely decorated, however lacking in bathroom amenities and the home wasn't as clean as expected (certain areas were dusty, sofas/sheets had a couple stains). The en-suite has very poor water drainage system too, so I highly discourage others to shower in it and instead, use the one in the living room."
"My family and I really enjoyed our stay at Shu__ lovely loft. It__ beautifully decorated, spacious and comfortable. 

It__ also located close to (2 mins walk) City Square Mall and Farrer Park MRT Station with plenty of restaurants and shops in the neighborhood. 

Highly recommended for a short or longer stay in Singapore! 

P.s Thank you so much Shu and Dolly for your gracious hospitality and recommendations! We will definitely be back "
Shu's Airbnb is a modern retreat in the heart of Singapore. The communication and check-in process were as seamless and as easy as they could get. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!
Shu__ place is awesome really stylish clean friendly personnel and centrally located. I would stay here the next time I visit Singapore. I highly recommend this Airbnb.
"Shu__ place was amazing - gorgeous high ceilings, and so much space!"
"This place was a perfect respite after busy, fast paced days out in the city!  We were comfortable and cool and the suite was peaceful.  Really enjoyed this central location and ease of traveling about from here.  The checkin and stay were all self-service and easy for us."
"Stayed in origins suite, bed comfortable and upstairs bedroom quite large with en-suite. Air conditioning worked well which is important in Singapore. She provided lots of advice on local attractions, directions. Checkin is was easy. Close to Farrer park mtr, so easy to get anywhere in City, nearby shopping centre. Good location to stay if needing to be near Little India. Very safe, but then everywhere is safe in Singapore. Cost $ 20 in taxi from airport. Happy with our stay, but photos made area seem nicer than it was"
Shu's place in 44 Petain was newly renovated and nice. Good central location and walking distance to food and grocery shopping. We would rent the same place again in future.
"Great location, beautiful building! The bed is also comfortable. That__ where the pros end. The cons are much more extensive. First off, the common areas are very hot and the walls are barren. It feels unloved and impersonal, like a hospital. Shu is very cheap when it comes to utilities and water. She also sends you a mile long list of house rules and is slow to reply to guests. I would not recommend this place. It__ a poor value. The guest service is terrible. Dolly is caretaker on site, and she__ a sweet woman, but she has no access to the AirBnB account. Shu is the owner in the USA and she relays messages to Dolly. What an absurd way to run a business. The kitchen and bathroom have minimal stocking. Yes the photos are accurate, but then you realize the place is decorated with IKEA crap and all the cupboards are empty. There__ like a dozen empty cupboards and the bathroom is practically empty. Shu posts annoying and patronizing notes all over the unit reminding you of house rules, even going so far as to ask you to turn off the shower while you soap up. Then there are notes saying to remove shoes __or your safety_. Safety? Come on. I did not feel welcome. The owner is anal. The service was poor. The value is poor. Spend your $250/night elsewhere. It__ unfortunate because the building is gorgeous and it__ right next to Little India, but the property is wasted on Shu. Don__ stay here. You can do better. Shu needs to learn a little bit about hospitality if she wants to charge premium rates. The labyrinthine hallway to the penthouse is very long and empty, if she added some artwork it would really improve the place. Instead it feels sterile. I did not see any other guests, and only interacted with Dolly one time when I woke up and she was already in my room, troubleshooting the Netflix problem. She never resolved the problem. This place gets 2 stars, but only for the architecture and location. The rest is crap. It took hours to cool the unit down. For a premium hotel I__ expect common areas to be less than 36 C. It took hours to cool the penthouse unit down because of the high ceilings. Singapore is lovely, but I am left with a bad taste in my mouth. Vote with your dollars, folks! I don__ know how this achieved Superhost status because it does not deserve it. I asked for a late checkout twice, then after receiving no reply, I was given an automated reminder to leave by 11 am. I was livid. I was told that Dolly was text messaging me. Well guess what? She was using my American phone number and I don__ use a global plan. I__e been to four countries this month and kept buying SIM cards, so of course I received nothing from her. She should be using AirBnB to communicate exactly for this reason. She chooses not to, perhaps Shu doesn__ trust Dolly with the AirBnB login? Perhaps she doesn__ want AirBnB to have a record of interactions. In any event it was unacceptable. The ad fails to mention that the penthouse has no elevator and you__l have to scale five hot flights of stairs to get to the room. Not exactly convenient when you have 100 kg of luggage like I did. Shu, if you read this, please rethink your management style. It needs work. Dolly can__ do her job if she has no access to the account. You need to stop treating guests like an imposition. Your house rules took 20 minutes to read. My family has owned bed and breakfasts in California and I__e helped manage them, so I know a thing or two about how a guests should be treated. This is not it."
Nice stylish space up in the Little India neighborhood of Singapore.  Easy access to public transportation and great local cafes and restaurants.
Good
"We stayed at shu's place for 3 nights. It was an amazing stay where shu's house has a very good taste of interior design. Very spacious, good nature lightning, a lot of restaurant nearby, very convinient l. RECOMMENDED!"
Everything is ok but too may stairs.
"We had a wonderful time in the apartment. We loved staying in an historic house, that was renovated to give a modern and stylish experience. The location was also great, close to cool areas with great transportation options, yet far enough from the masses in the city center. The keeper of the house was very responsive and took care of everything we needed. Highly recommended."
"What a beautiful space. It__ like an art and history museum. My family and I enjoyed lounging around the loft watching Netflix, and that in itself feels like a holiday destination. The views are gorgeous. There are ample space to lounge, work and sleep because there are essentially 2.5 levels. The entrance to the loft is magical."
"Lovely modernized Singaporean shophouse in a very convenient location, very close to MRT and Little India. Apartment was exactly as presented on-line and was modern, clean and airy with excellent air con and modern, tasteful and calming dÃ©cor. Shu responded quickly to all our correspondence and provided very detailed instructions for check-in/check-out etc.  If you want to stay somewhere a little different with modern conveniences but with old world Singaporean charm and character, I would strongly recommend you stay here. We loved it."
"I didn't love the location and we ordered a Grab (Uber) most places we needed to go. The pics make the place look a little better than the actual unit. Check-in in process was a little difficult because the keypad was hard to use and there are a lot of instructions to go through.  However Shu's communication was great, we felt very safe the whole time, and I appreciate her for hosting us."
"Great place in cool neighborhood/building. Closer to everything downtown than we expected, we were able to walk a lot of places. The train is also close and convenient. As mentioned in the information you will need to climb some stairs but that was well communicated. Would recommend. Thanks!"
"__å¾_____æ¥¼é¡¶å±,è£_½¢ç®çº¦å¥½____¾ç____,å°±æ_è¡_____»æ__¹ç´¯ï½¡ä_ç½¾¿_©å__¹ä¾¿_______º¤"
Good communication and advice for new visitors of the city. The house is of great design and attractive. Would definitely come back if I visit Singapore again.
"great value, better than staying in a cramped little hotel room for a similar price"
"This shophouse and loft were gorgeous. The loft is spacious, well decorated and very centrally located. The AC cools the apartment quickly which is a huge plus in the Singapore heat! Our only issue was a high pitched humming noise that seemed to be associated with the upstairs AC. This came and went. Dolly and Shu were easy to get in contact with and very kind! Check in was simple and it was overall a good experience!"
"Beautiful apartment and such a great location!!
If you are looking to experience local neighborhoods in Singapore, this is a perfect place to stay at.

It nestle in between little India town and China town. Lots of food places that opens late...

We love this spot and will definitely return."
"One of the most unique and stylish Air BnBs I have ever lived in! Shu has transformed the heritage shophouses into beautiful living spaces. The location is great, close enough to the busy and eclectic Little India, but still holding it's own in quiet and comfortable Petain Road. Shu and Dolly (housekeeper) make the stay very easy - lots of instructions and quick fixes by Dolly when I drop her messages. All in all, a very unique and wonderful experience."
We really enjoyed our stay. Great location in a beautiful heritage cheek Singaporean shophouse. Very close to the Farrar Park MRT station and lots of buses nearby. Shu's guide with local places to eat was extremely helpful and much appreciated.
Experienced a circuit trip quite often in the loft I stayed but the house manager was responsive and fixed it in time. Overall the house is gorgeous and filled with useful amenities. Never have to step out of the house.
Nice house but a little bit far from downtown.I recommend to consider the location when book the hotel and Airbnb.
I stayed at the Shophouse during a short business trip to Singapore. It was my third time a the Shophouse and it didn't disappoint - I had everything I needed and Shu and her housekeeper were great at communicating and making me feel welcome. Highly recommend for a comfortable stay in Singapore.
"Lovely apartment on 2 levels : lower level has a bathroom, kitchen + dining area and a living room with large flat screen smart TV. On upper level is a study and a spacious bedroom with lovely comfortable bed and a beautiful bathroom. Upstairs too there is a large flat screen smart TV. Netflix can be watched on both TV's - Yay!! 
Apartment is bright, white, clean, pristine - just like the pics. Location is superb - very close to Mustafa centre and Mustafa Currency Exchange (best rates). Close to a good mall 'City Square Mall' with great shopping and restaurants and even a Fair Price (Supermarket). So it's easy to catch a decent meal close to home after a long day of site seeing or lazing about at home. 
Yet inspite of being so close to Little India, the location is quiet and there is hardly any traffic noise.
On the last day we had to check out by 11am, but our flight was at night at 8pm. They were happy to have us leave our luggage there the entire day in the ground floor waiting lounge while we went out to explore. We got back early evening, collected our luggage and left for the airport - very convenient
Only warning - This apartment is on the 4th floor - as it is a shophouse style home. This proves to be a bit of a trudge when you are tired at the end of the day and a challenge with big luggage. 
But the location and overall convenience totally makes it worth it!!"
"Amazing space and location. Very stylish roomy and cozy. Only issue we had was  we can__ use the showers in the bedroom and in the living room at the same time, the water in the 2nd floor stops when the other is used. Not a big deal for us, we really love the place and the location is just perfect."
"Extraordinary place and value! Always a nice feeling of safety with the security, and the lockable rooms guarantee peace of mind. Couldn__ get a better location, where you__e in the center of everything and it__ all immediately accessible. The view is amazing and you__l be able to see each destination you want to explore. 

The hospitality and generosity from the host was incredible. Attentive and accommodating."
Had an enjoyable stay. Thank you Hilary.
"The place is really nice and the location is excellent.  Very close to the Lavender MRT and a shopping mall. Host is a very supportive person and always willing to assist you at any time, I will definitely recommend this place!! And hope to some day come back again!"
Hilary's response to scenarios during coven-19 was shift and very accommodating.
Very convenient stay for those that are working closeby to the city area.
Very neat and clean rooms and the amenities were also excellent. Much satisfied.

Good location near mrt w mall and foodcourt.
"Clean, quiet room. Near mrt, malls.  Fast food & many eateries nearby."
This the Best  place to stay  i like
"Our long stay in this place was peaceful and fine. The location is very near to MRT and food shops. Seemingly, the unit was like newly renovated thus, clean."
"Very fast responses. Location is a bit far from the city, approximately 1 hour via bus. Room is very clean."
"With this affordable and very reasonable price, Overall experience was great! Place is quiet,sparkling clean , seems new and excellent room airconditioning. Hence,we had very comfortable stay.Dont mind if its not within the city since location is just steps away from yewtee mrt where u can go anywhere in SG.There's A mall nearby just within the mrt and many cheap eateries around.Host is kind and generous enough to let us use washing machine, ref, microwave,iron.He's very quick to respond in text. He even allowed us to  checkout late @4pm due to our delayed flight in the evening. Thank you for your hospitality, Kiatster :)"
Clean and stylish house. Host is always available for commutation and always helpful.
"The hosts were really nice and communication was easy and fast. We got to even use their washing machine to wash our clothes. The place is really clean and just like described. The location is far from the city centre, but if that travel time doesn__ bother you the train station is right next to the apartment and it__ really easy to get to the city."
This is a very nice home and is a perfect location if you are looking to catch the bus to Malaysia as well. It__ a bit far outside of downtown Singapore but I would definitely recommend staying here.
House is clean and near MRT Station.
I arrived Kiatster__ house at 4 AM and he greeted me warmly. He is my super host in Airbnb through my solo trip in southeast Asia. I hight suggest to stay his house. You just only walk 1 minute to the train station. Everything is all in one. Where is else you can stay in Singapore with a cheap price accommodation? U would feel like it__ your home when you stay with him. Everyone including the neighbors respects each other- meaning they keep silent at night. It would be a great time at nigh to sleep after a long walk in CBD of Singapore. Have a great day- From Kiri
"A great stay. Quiet place, great community and with good proximity to the train station."
"Kiatster's place is near the MRT station, McDo, and a small mall, there's some local eats beside the station too. The neighborhood is quiet. The place itself is very very nice. Clean, spacious, and complete! Toiletries, kitchen appliances and washer. Our room was furnished with the basics -- aircon, ceiling fan, table, bed and closet -- and that's all you need. Our stay there was really comfortable and if I visit to Singapore again, I'll definitely seek out Kiatster's place again."
"Near the Mrt, have a lot of restaurants, a lit bit far from the center but it__ ok you can take the mrt to thÆ° centre easily, the room is clean and nice, I like it."
"the house was clean, and good."
Stanza umile in appartamento pulito. Vicinissimo ad una fermata di metropolitana e ad un centro commerciale
"A very nice place, clean and peaceful."
The host is very nice and the room is very clean. It was value for money. The location is easy accessible by mrt and there have a lot of food court/ mall
"The place is very clean, very convenient, 3mins walk to MRT. owners are friendly and helpful. Would strongly recommend this place for stay:)"
"Kiatster's place is 5 min walk away from Yew Tee MRT and shopping mall. The room is tidy and clean. The host is very friendly and accommodating, I was unable to be there for the check in time stated, he responded in no time and allowed me to leave my luggage at his place before the check in time. Overall a great stay. Definitely recommended."
Convenient and nice place!
Super cool stylish place! Real experience.
"I enjoyed my stay at this newly-renovated old shophouse. It__ a cozy and spacious studio with high ceiling, with a unique vibe and old colonial touch.  Host and staff were personable and responsive in answering questions via texts and resolving issues."
"Beautiful apartment! The whole place had a lovely cultural vibe to it. Close proximity to City Square mall and Farrer Park MRT, which made it very convenient. And Shu was easy to reach when anything was needed, and super accommodating. Lovely experience!"

The interior has been transformed ;quiet, modern and simple, we had a wonderful week here. Shu was very nice and helpful. We tried the restaurant she recommended, which had very delicious local food, and of course Dolly, many thanks for her._Yes,I will stay here again when i come back SG"
"The botanical room we stayed at is stylish and sparking clean. Shu provides a very detailed instructions on how to get there, which makes us less anxious in getting around a new city. The house manager Dolly is very quick to respond to our phone call. Probably the only minor drawback is that the room is on the third floor. So do expect a workout if you carry a heavy luggage like me. Otherwise, the shophouse is beautiful and is really an experience we enjoyed."
"Shu__ place is a cute historical shop house redecorated in a modern stylish condo.
It is situated very close to Little India with many places to eat and shop.
Although we had one night without hot water and some loud neighbors, Dolly, the caretaker, was always there to help and very quick to respond.
Shu gave us great tips about the neighborhood and we were able to enjoy great food.
Check in and check out was smooth.
The place is very very nice and highly recommended."
"It was a very nice stay, the room is very minimal style and tidy."
"This shophouse and the Botanical studio is beautiful. Delightful design touches, perfectly clean and spacious in it's layout and the way it's organised, even though it's not big. The exterior of the shophouse must be one of the prettiest we've seen in Singapore. And the area is just perfect. Central and close to public transport but it still has a more cultural, neighbourhood feel."
"Shu__ place was great a traditional shop house but renovated to sleek rooms. 

The room was exactly what we needed it for our stay in Singapore. Close by to mall and public transportation. 

Not a ding but just a watch out if you__e a light sleeper like myself, It does get very loud when it rains because right outside the window is roof of another building so the sound comes right through not much of a sound barrier. 

Dolly was easy to find and communicate with even helped us out when needed. 

But overall a great experience would stay again."
"Shu was very nice and helpful. The shophouse is beautiful and the rooms are very well designed. My room wasn't as clean as I thought it would be, but still acceptable. Overall, my stay at Shu's was pretty good! Would recommend! :)"
This was a fantastic place. I felt very clean and safe staying here.
"Great apartment, quiet and fantastic location! The check-in process was easy and Dolly was super responsive. The whole experience with Shu was great! I highly recommend this apartment during your stay in Singapore."
"Nice room, suitable for tourists."
"Unique, clean and quiet property.  Quick walk to the City Center Mall and MRT.  Comprehensive directions and local guides.  Super responsive and helpful."

"The listing is 3-5 minutes away from Farrer Park MRT Station (City Square Mall), and walking distance to the popular Mustafa Shopping Centre. The check-in was super easy, but accessibility would be harder for folks who are not used to climbing floors. 

It was a great experience for my mom, as it was her first time to stay at an Airbnb. Dolly was such a great help for us, and was always available to answer our questions and help needed.

Kudos to Shu & Dolly for a very wonderful stay at Botanical. :)"
Lovely quaint studio in the heart of Singapore! I love that the location is central and close to a lot of the places we planned to visit. The shophouse itself is well decorated and charming. Communication between Shu and Dolly was easy and quick. Very good value for money for anyone looking for a place to stay whilst visiting Singapore.
"Stayed here with my boyfriend for the F1. It was so lovely and clean and easy to get around from. Walkable distance from little India and lots of other great dumpling places. Air conditioning very effective so nice to come home to after a day out walking. 
Everything is set up for a smooth checkin and check out (very detailed list of instructions) so we didn__ meet the host or have interaction with anyone. Slightly slow responses and not much engagement ahead of, or during our stay.

Thank you Shu, would recommend to all."
"Shu's place is lovely, and she clearly has an artistic and stylish touch for home decor. Loved the vibe of the room, not to mention most importantly, it was clean. Bathroom was more spacious than we expected, which was great. The check-in and check-out arrangement is easy and well planned out, convenient for both parties. The tv has Netflix too - added bonus! Thanks again, Shu!"
"The Shophouse is everything we expected and much more. The check in and check out process was straightforward, the amenities were great and the room itself was beautiful, large and very homely. Shu was wonderful and sent us countless suggestions for restaurants/bars/cafes in the area as well as her favourites throughout Singapore. We thoroughly enjoyed the area and felt that we managed to experience the real Singapore as opposed to the touristy Downtown Core (which is beautiful also!). If you__e a coffee lover, we had the best coffee shops only a 2 minute walk away! Thanks again to Shu for allowing us to stay in her beautiful shophouse. An amazing stay overall."
"We had a great stay at Shu's shophouse. Even though we didn't meet anyone in person, everything was where it was said to be and we had a relatively seamless experience. Only downside is the lack of blinds on the window in the door frame meant it was impossible to get the room dark at night which made sleeping challenging."
Fantastic fantastic fantastic home.
"Great location, very nice spacious apartment and a lot of restaurant tips. Thanks Shu :-)"

"Lovely traditionally shop house. Like most airbnb pictures it appears bigger than it is. Wasn__ expecting the communal area but it was a nice surprise if you want to chat to other guests. 

Nice location for getting about in Singapore and some decent coffee, craft beer and restaurants nearby. I would recommend Shu__ place if you__e visiting Singapore."

Location was out of hustle and bustle by 10 minutes was is great for winding down at the end of a day! The space is beautiful and would definitely recommend.
"Great local shophouse experience in Singapore, close to Little India and Chinatown. Centrally located and lots of local bars and restaurants."
"Clean apartment, although the bathroom was not as clean. Quick to respond, and checking in and out was easy. Centrally located (near the MRT)."
"Apartment is in a stunning building and has a lovely atmospheric shared lounge. Location is good, mall and MRT entrance less than five minutes away. Apartment was comfortable and quiet so sleeping was good.  Bathroom was ok but tiling needs updating."
Great house with art vibes. Recommended
"We had a great stay and the room was clean and stylish. Hospitality was great - the house manager, Dolly, helped us order a cab to the airport at 5:30AM the morning of our flight."
Cozy and stylish place in a conserved shop house.
"Wonderful space and Shu a fantastic communicator.  Her 'secret weapon' Dolly also an incredible asset and is available to lend support whenever required.   Super quiet although a heartbeat away from Serangoon Road.  
We will return
Thank you !!"
We loved this stay soooo much! It is absolutely adorable! The building itself is also so cute with so much character. All the amenities were perfect. One of the days it rained so we stayed in and enjoyed the smart TV (signed into our Netflix for a great binge worthy afternoon on the comfy pull out couch) and used the kitchen for snack time :) The housekeeper is extremely helpful and gives quick responses. 10/10 would recommend to a friend.
An authentic awesome Singapore shop house in a great location. Rooms are nice and you feel at home...
"Shu provided us with detailed instructions about apartment, check-in and check-out. List with places to visit/ where to eat was great and very helpful! Location of apartment is good, just in waking distance to two metro lines. The only thing that could be improved is bathroom: it__ crying for renovation."
"Everything's just easy which is what you want it to be! Checking in, laundry access, close to transport, homely, private, comfy and fabulous. Had a great time."
Will fully recommend it to anyone who is looking for a comfortable home but a stylish interior
A unique home and experience living in a shophouse.
Awesome little place with great location..
such an amazing and clean place! would definitely book again in the future. thank you _¤ï_
"Shu is great, responsive and helpful host. We had an issue with the Netflix and they sorted it out immediately for us. The loft is amazing, stylish, quiet and clean. We enjoyed our stay very much."
"Everything has surpassed my expectation. Clean, cozy, well decorated, and quiet. Look forward to going back again!"
Nice
"Great space and convenient, the whole process and decor is definitely worth the money :)"
Great location. Near MRT station. Nice place

"Great space - it has everything you need, very clean and new, photos and description are accurate, nice pool with a good view. Lots of good restaurants right outside the apartment. Close to East Coast Park. Sherrie is a super helpful and responsive host."
Nice place; good communication; had a delightful stay in here
Sherrie__ home was outstanding; it had the accommodations and amenities that we were looking for. Sherrie was very communicative and made sure we had a great stay. Would recommend to anyone.
Sherrie__ place was just as described. Check in was simple. Many places nearby to eat. Highly recommend!
It was a clean house in a better location than I expected. There is a big mall and many restaurants. Sherrie was friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this place.
Sherrie and Mike are wonderful hosts who will go at lengths to make your stay very comfortable. Beautifully and clean home with all the amenities you would need as a business traveller. I liked the soft pillows especially and extra linen / towels you may need during your stay. Their apartment is very quiet even though you step out onto a busy street with very good access to nearby malls and restaurants around East Coast. Five stars from me.
"I booked this apartment for my friends visiting from France, including a toddler. We were surprised to find toys and a portable crib for him. The size was just right for the family of 3 and the apartment was self-contained. 
Great and safe location with lots of eateries and shops, even an indoor playground at a mall just across the road. 
Sherrie was a very responsive and friendly host. Her thoughtful touches in the amenities made the stay very comfortable.
I will definitely book this apartment again for my other visitors."
"Sherrie and Mike's Nest is truly ""modern living in a food paradise"". It is a full size 1BR condo in a beautiful historical building in the very heart of Katong. All the essentials you would want are supplied for you in this modern space including blazing fast wifi, flatscreen TV, desk for doing work, cookware, washing machine, show that stays hot, multiple air conditioning units with temperature control, and more. The rooftop is my favorite place which has nice views of the surrounding areas and best of a long and narrow pool that pretty much spans the entire building from edge-to-edge. Due to the low number of units in the building__'ve rarely ever seen anybody up there day or night and it feels like my own personal pool. During the evenings when the sun is down I like to read my Kindle in this tranquil space. But the best feature of this building is its location. As described, it truly is a food paradise with two of the best Laska places right across the road from each other, and restaurants from pretty much every country within a few blocks. I even found a Mexican restaurant which I never thought I'd see in Singapore. Prices for these restaurants are very affordable but if you want to splurge there are a few super fancy options, too. Katong is truly a neighborhood you can live happily in for weeks without stepping a foot outside to other parts of the city, but if you do downtown is only a 15 minute Grab ride away. As hosts, Sherrie and Mike have done a great job of meeting promptly for checkin and also checking in via messenger to see if you need anything.  I would highly recommend staying at The Nest. It has met all expectations"
Sherrie__ place is at an amazing location where there are so many places to eat and so easy to get around. Her apartment is clean and cosy. We feel comfortable and relax. Hope to return again soon.
Great little apartment in the heart of Katong. Walking distance to lots of restaurants and cafes.
Had a pleasant stay at Sherrie's place!

"Lovely little home, great location with yummy food options on your doorstep. Sherrie was in contact before our visit to ensure we had a smooth arrival and had everything we needed which was very helpful, especially as we were travelling with a little one. Little touches like the small selection of toys helped keep her occupied when it was time for us to pack up hers and head back to the airport."
"Sherrie was a phenomenal and responsive host.  We had some random issues with the reservations and procedures and she went above and beyond in helping us get refunds and rebook even though customer support took awhile to respond. The Nest is in a great central location, while not the business district there is plenty to see and do in the neighborhood right outside the door!! Multiple food and drink options within walking distance, central to the bus and train lines, with Grab and easy and quick pick up option. Highly recommend downloading and using the grab app while in SGP due to the circuitous routes on the MRT. If you have multiple people in your group, you'll spend as much on grab as you will riding the trains if not less, for only a FRACTION of the time.  There are malls and grocery stores in walking distance and even full cakes if you're celebrating a special occasion.  I would definitely recommend her and would use it again.  Extra plus is the roofside pool!"
"Sherrie has created a perfect place for travellers. It is very modern, clean and comfortable. We wish we had more time to enjoy the rooftop swimming pool! The location is smack in the middle of a wide range of cuisines to suit Asian and Western palates. There is an ice-cream joint directly under the apartment that is packed every night.
Most of all, Sherrie was very flexible,  communicates clearly and promptly. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will do so again we are in the region again. 
Thanks, Sherrie, for making feel so welcome."
"Sherrie is such a great host, quick response and warm welcome from Mike that made check in very easy. The nest is close to lots of food places & bus stop & shopping centre. Sherrie also provided some toys for my daughter to play, which is very thoughtful. Thanks Sherrie & Mike, we all enjoyed our stay at your place. Take care."
"My wife and I had a great 5 night stay at Sherrie__ Nest in Katong.
Sherrie met us as we were getting out of our taxi just outside the condo by the botanical gelato shop - __irds of Paradise_ (so good!!).
Communication was fast and efficient and Sherrie had a lot of suggestions about the local food scene.

The Nest exceeded our expectations.  It was very modern, spacious, private and quiet with a nice modern bathroom with a fantastic shower.  The bed was very comfortable and the two slit AC units kept everything cool.

We have stayed in Singapore many times but never explored the Katong area.
We are glad that we did on this trip, hope to come back someday and would not hesitate to stay here again."
"In terms of location, one could not ask for better!  A wonderful neighborhood, lots of fantastic eateries, close to shops, transportation, etc.   The apartment itself very quiet despite its central location."
"Lovely quiet apartment right near I12 Katong and Joo Chiat Rd. 
Plenty of cafes and restaurants on your doorstep.
Apartment is nice and clean, would benefit from some basic condiments which are always appreciated while travelling.
We didn__ get to meet Sherrie but she was very attentive to any questions via messages.
Would definitely stay again and also recommend to our friends."
It is a nice place
"Sherrie__ place is exceptionally clean and nearby to eateries and also she is quick in responding to any queries.  Her place has everything you need for a comfortable stay. If you need to go to city center, you can always use Grab or taxis are easily available outside. Had a wonderful stay at Sherrie__ place. Looking forward to visit again!"
"A small tidy 2 room apartment in a lovely area close to public transport. The apartment is basic but has everything you need to enjoy your stay, including a washing machine/dryer and cooking facilities. The only thing it didn__ have was an iron and upon asking this could not be provided. The host did suggest a oval laundry service but this was expensive when all I needed was to iron a dress. The pool on the roof was lovely and offered great views. The location is not close enough to walk to the city, however Taxi__ and buses are. Heap and you get a great community feel staying in this area. The host was a great communicator and was very responsive. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to other travellers."

"Did not realized how cool this area was. I just wanted a place located  semi-close to the airport and found this place. What a special location this place was.  A lot of food courts, bars, restaurants and shopping in this area. The unit is clean and modern with all the comforts of your own home. Washer and dryer was a huge plus! Thank you Sherrie!"

"This is the second time we stayed at Sherrie__. We always feel comfortable and at ease when we are there. 

The apartment is clean and everything in the apartment work properly. 

The location of the apartment is very convenient to travel around. Restaurants, shops and malls are within walking distance. 

Sherrie is quick to respond to my queries and always letting me know she is there to help if needed. Thank you Sherrie. 

Hope we can meet again at my next trip."
Lovely apartment right where lots of food and only 5-10 pounds to centre city using grab taxi. Short walk down to east coast beach and fun on escooters too.
Sherrie's place was as described.  The location was central to many eateries and a shopping mall across the street was handy.  The road is busy but Sherrie's place was very quiet.  We enjoyed our stay and would recommend.
"Sherrie's place was amazingly located and very convenient for us. And highly recommending this place to family with young childrens, and the pool was amazing and we had a wonderful time staying here. And the check-in and check out process was easy and Sherrie even came to meet us in the middle of the night."
"Sherrie and her helper Maria really made us and our boy feel at home. We loved staying in such an easy modern house with a lovely rooftop pool, so private and at the same time right in the middle of East Coast road, so close to the market, the laksa restaurant, the Hindu temple, and all those beautiful houses in Ceylon road. Will definitely come back again!"
"Beautiful house. Easy access to everything around.
Very clean and comfortable to live. Felt like home.
The host Sherrie has been great and very quick at her responses. Not a single problem that we faced here. Right from check in to check out, everything was very smooth."
"The Nest was a great apartment, Sherrie was very easy to communicate with and had lots of local tips. 328 Laksa was amazing. Once you figure out the buses transport is easy, there is a stop just down the road."
"Excelente ubicaciÃ³n con restaurantes, cafÃ©s y shopping centre cerca. Muy bien equipado y la comunicaciÃ³n con Sherrie es sÃºper rÃ¡pida. Seguro regresarÃ­a."
"Her place was the best stay for us in Singapore! I'd love to come back her place, when we visit Singapore next time again. It was most comfortable place. We loved the pool as well!! A+++++"

"Sherrie was waiting for us in front of building while we arrived, she not just helped us check in & gave a tour of home/amenities/etc, but also helped carrying our luggage__ up-down twice, thank you! 

The home was clean, but since we had an infant who would crawl all over, we were a little extra cautious and ended up cleaning the place little more per our expectations, probably new parent ocd. We felt the same way about vessels since we esp wanted to cook for our daughter. 

Overall our stay was great, calm place, nice pool on attic, great host, etc."
"Always a great stay at The Nest! Great location, pool, air-conditioning, and everything. Since I last visited there is a new keyless entry which is nice. Would def come back anytime I want to stay in the Katong area!"
"This apartment had everything we needed, and it is in a great neighborhood. Katong has many restaurants and shops, and is close to East Coast Park. The apartment was exactly as advertised in the listing, the host is extremely responsive and helpful, and the rooftop pool was a lovely amenity in which to cool off.  We hope to return soon."

Our daughter enjoyed playing with the toys provided by the host too! We didn__ have time to use the pool, but we did use the gym which was very convenient. Parking was easy enough and there are so many restaurants at your fingertips. We look forward to staying again!"
We loved staying at the Nest. Our first time in Singapore and we loved Katong. Such a great neighborhood. Sherrie was very responsive and accommodating. Highly recommend!
"Great place to stay, Sherrie is a fantastic host!"
Sheryl is a good host. She came to receive us and helped us with our luggage. The location of the apartment is excellent. There are many restaurants nearby. There  are also bus stations just across the street. There is a grocery store around which is open 24 hours. I would love to stay in the apartment again.
"Sheryl was helpful, communicative and her place was easy to access, sparkling clean and convenient. We were never more than five steps away from good food, supermarkets and bars. The place was very family friendly and the rooftop pool offered a great respite for a sunny climate. The nearby beach was gorgeous and easily accessible to. Overall we had a ball and will definitely be back agqin."
"walkable area, great pool, and clean spacious apartment."
"Great location, tidy, modern
Quick response
Would love to visit again"
"Fantastic accommodation in Katong. Clean and modern, and extremely well located for the area (both for access to transport, walking to the beach, the famous Katong eateries and a really good supermarket, including Western and Asian options, within 5 minutes walk). We found the host to be really good in communication and very accommodating and helpful. This was a great place to stay with a one year old baby.

We would stay here again in a heartbeat."
We stayed for a week at Sheryl's place with two kids. It was comfortable and convenient.
"This was our second five night stay at the Nest (see first review for specifics) and it was even better this time as we were already familiar with the apartment and the area.

Katong is a vibrant and special part of Singapore and the Nest is a quiet, safe and convenient place to stay.

We hope to return to Katong and the Nest on future visits to Singapore."
"The place is bigger then other studios I've stayed in, location is the best in singapore for food and everything about food. Will recommend trying it out"
"Pros
Well connected to city.
Food courts and eatery just outside on the road
Ideal for couples
Clean and tidy place
Good kitchen utensils
Taxi available with in 2-5 mins. We never had to wait
Good Air con
Flexible and prompt communication with Sheryl


Cons
No views outside the windows since it is on a mezzanine floor. The views are of neighbors terrace and back of house area
No plug points in bathroom could be a problem for your Mrs.

Overall 
It is similar to what is shown in photos and if you are busy travelling around Singapore and come to the apartment only to sleep you won't bother much about the views 
Sheryl is a very responsive host and responded to our messages straight away.
Everything was clean and arranged properly."
"Le sÃ©jour au Nest n'aurait pas pu mieux se passer: un emplacement idÃ©al que ce soit pour manger (que de bonnes adresses dans la rue et pour tous les goÃ»ts) ou aller au centre ville (15 minutes en voiture ou 25 minutes en bus du Marina Bay), une piscine trÃ¨s agrÃ©able et au calme, une rÃ©activitÃ© de la part de l'hÃ´te _ souligner. Je recommande vivement ce logement"
Top notch customer service.  Fast n Efficient Reply.. cleaniness was superb.  100 percent recommended. Will return soon
We enjoyed Sheryl and Mike__ apartment. Loved the neighbourhood ! She was quick to answer any question and help out if needed it. I recommend this place!
"Clean, accurate, fast response, great location, and quiet modern place living!"
Great repeat stay!  And amazing host!
Sheryl really helped us by replying instantly. The house was really clean and much felt like home. :) Thank you for the stay!
"Sheryl as a host is warm, responsive and well organized. It was a seamless experience. I look forward to returning again some time in the future!"
Sheryl's place is spick and span. I have a great stay for two nights. Looking forward to my next stay.
this place is very cozy and we really enjoy our stay here. This is one of the best air bnb stay i have experience.
"Love the room , Sheryl very Friendly too

"Just try out, "
"Had a great weekend here, great location, clean and lovely apartment. Would love to come back again"
"Great location, clean, big and stylist apartment. Responsive host."

"Very good location and value, clean and well furnished space for short stays. Lots of dining and entertainment options nearby."
"Sheryl__ place was great! It was located right beside the eatery hustle and bustle of east coast. 
The place itself was also very clean and had what we needed. There was also some toys she put there which my kid really enjoyed playing with! Was such a sweet touch to have that.
She also had a toddler chair and a little step on for my kid to wash his hands in the sink
We enjoyed a dip in the pool also and it wasn__ cold!
Sheryl was also exponentially pleasant, always responded quickly, and even let us check out late bcs no one booked on the same day.

I really enjoyed my stay here and would reccomend place, esp if you are bringing kids :)"
"Nice location, near lots of food. Sheryl was quick to respond to my booking."
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Sheryl's lovely apartment. The whole place was really clean, and the amenities were all provided as stated in the listing. The apartment was also situated at an extremely convenient location to many eateries/cafes around the area, either by walking distance or just 1-2 bus stops away. "
"Very nice and comfortable apartment. The location is great, so much  cafes/bars to choose from. Lovely area. We loved our stay at Sharyl__ place, can definitely recommend."
"Home was nice and clean smelling, location is great which is right smack in the heart of Katong(lots of local eateries around) and amenities aplenty to cater to all your daily needs. Lots of transport options as well! Pleasant stay overall."
Good amenities and clean. Right in the middle of lots of good food. Wonderful for staycations or a weekend getaway.
"I enjoyed so much my stay at Sheryl's place. The cleanness of the apartment, the location, the smooth check-in and check-out processes, and the agile response of Sheryl to all my queries made my stay smooth and happy."
good host
"The family is full of love. The house is sweet, but just a little bit far from downtown."
"Amazing stay in Natasha's house, beautiful room with aircon and fan, comfortable beds. Buses close by that take you to the city. Overall a great experience. Natasha and her family were very helpful and always available. Great contact from the start. Highly recommended!"
"The moment you enter the House you can feel the warmth and love in the air. The whole family is full of love. The house is beautiful and way better than how it looks in the pictures. The pool and the green garden makes it a peaceful and a dream place to live. Natasha was kind and went out of the way to buy and get us a new bed the moment she found that it had issues. The kitchen is fully equipped to allow you to cook any cuisine.  Bathroom and rooms are sparkling clean. Overall, a fantastic house. Can't imagine a better place to live in Singapore."
"Excellent stay in a wonderful and quiet place. Natasha and her family helped with everything. The room is clean, like the whole house. You can use the fully equipped kitchen and cook. Everything fits the description and the pictures. Near the bus stop, you can easily reach the center or use the MRT. Our baby and we are very pleased with the pool and the green zone. The best place to stay in Singapore."
"Expect to walk a lot if you're taking the MRT. It's WAY further than what you'd expect. Can't adjust the air conditioner temperature, it's a furnace with the humid weather."
"Location is very accessible. 
The house is cozy with a private swimming pool.  
They have friendly dogs , they just bark but doesnt bite you at all (so nothing to be scared)

Miss Natasha is so responsive to all my queries. She is very patient. Check-in and check out is flexible. 
The host is really hospitable."
Best place to stay in Singapore! We loved the pool! The dogs are big but friendly. We had a room upstairs with nice view to the garden. Good air condition and fan and quiet in the night. Very nice hosts.
"Had an amazing one-month experience at Natasha__ place.
Indeed, the house is located in a calm neighborhood, 2 mins walk to the bus station. 
Also, well decorated, spacious, modern, clean ... and equipped with everything you need. 
The room and private bathroom were big enough for 3 people. 

Natasha is a great host and made us feel at ease. 

Thank you so much Natasha and to your family for sharing your home with us.

Would absolutely recommend to stay there!"
"What a pleasant stay at Nathasha__lace ! 
The location is very cool, very quiet and city center accessible by bus and MRT! 
The home is very beautiful, very clean with a lot of space ! 
Natasha and her family were very kind to us, always available to have a chat, to help us and give us tips ! 
It was an amazing stay! Thank you again !"
There are 3 dogs inside the house who will bark at you if you are new to them. They won't bite though and it's better not to befriend them just to avoid anything bad happening. We had a very good experience inside the house.
Very comfortable property located in a peaceful part of Singapore. Hosts were very welcoming and would stay here again when travelling in Singapore
"Very good experience, will recommend for friends!! Really good landlord! Nice "
"Natasha has a wonderful home and we are very happy with our stay there. It's a quiet and nice neighbourhood. I have no problem with accessibility since I drove there and I have no problem parking in front or at suitable road side spots nearby. The house is spacious and clean and her keepers were able to answer to our needs quickly. My children had a good time in the pool during one of the afternoon, but we also try to minimize our disturbance to our host family. Overall, we are very happy with our stay there and we look forward to future stays!"
"Nice spacious room and house to stay at, friendly helpful people and helpers around. 
- Great value for money!
Bring mosquito repellent and you__l be fine. Don__ go though, if you dislike dogs or have small children as they have three big dogs."
"It is clearly better than what we expected before, clearly this place is a hidden gem! will stay here again if i go to singapore next time!"
"Wonderful place to be. The house is beautiful and is only 5 minutes walk away from the nearest bus stop. The hosts were very generous and allowed us to use the kitchen as we wished. The helpers also came to our aid whenever we needed. The location is well-connected through bus and is also on the East-West line which directly connects to Changi Airport. The Clementi Mall (only 10 minutes away, 4 stops by bus) meets almost all shopping needs that one may have.  The place is clean and the neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. And the dogs are the best."

Big room for 5 person in safe neighborhood
Clean and spacious room...and a great place for kids..Also they serve a good breakfast in the morning for a small fee...
Great stay!
Nice stay. The room is clean. Everything was ok.
It was a good place to crash.
"The house is not hard to find even if it's a bit far away from the city. Transportation is not a problem because it would only take a few walk from the house to the bus station. You will feel secure and comfortable in the house and the people are very welcoming. 

Natasha, thank you so much for the pleasant stay in your house. Sending our regards to your family and to our ""kababayan"" Mila as well.

Cheers,"
Natasha and her family are great hosts. They have lovely house and three amazing and friendly dogs. We stayed couple of days at their place and enjoyed the overall stay without picking out on anything. Will definitely recommend this place to you.
Good place
Good cheap place to stay. Very near 24 hour food place and supermarkets. 2 Min walk MRT. Would recommend for someone who wants a budget stay in Singapore.
"Host is nice and responsive, provided self checkin instructions and everything went well. Location was very good, other house mates friendly. Cleaner on-site helped with some orientations. Recommended!"
"Great.
Quick response.

"Great place at a great location. Tuck shop is just across the street if you need water and there are restaurants just below the apartment. Check-in was easy as the host's brother shared a video on how to check in. 

Just a small note, the toilet exhaust is not working but I'm sure the host will get it fixed :)"
"Hi Kate,

Thanks for being our host, I am happy to have selected your house for our stay.
House was near to MRT and airport too.  Also, communicating with Kate was quite hassle free, though we could not meet her in person.

Thank you very much kate for allowing us to use house even after check-out time, 4 hours extended check-out.

Top terrace view at pool side was quite enjoyable. We really enjoyed our stay there. Would recommend others to have an experince of being Kate's guests in Singapore :)"
Apartment was minutes to the MRT and just a few seconds to the bus stop. Many famous eateries around! Apartment was clean and spacious. Even had a private balcony to the roof top pool. Communication was easy and responsive. I highly recommend this airbnb listing.
"Definitely the worst experience I've ever had at a Airbnb. Sadly, the place I booked was nothing like how the picture is illustrated."
Absolute delight to be hosted by Kate. Full amenities within the apartment; many many great local eats nearby. Suitable for 2 couples stay. Lovely lap pool on roof top. Highly recommended for staycations to test out the local delights.
"Good place . Good amenities . Only issue , 2nd floor toilet water is too small ."
"Nice place with minimalistic decor. The water pressure on the second level was quite weak. The lower floor is facing the main road, therefore can get real noisy during heavy traffic. Check in was smooth and host was contactable at all times."
Its a good location
"we really enjoy our stay at 69 Sophia Road, it is close to the stations that connect us to everywhere, it is easy to find halal food ( Bencoolen St) and we really enjoy walking along to Orchard Road. This accomodations fits our need, we travel with 5 adults and 3 children, really help us to prepare food for the children and laundry as well. Air conditioners are working . very reccomended place for stay in Singapore."
My parents had great time here. Aaron's place is very clean and tidy.
"nice place with easy access to restaurant and nearby places, very nice hosts"
Spacious and in a convenient area and well served by public transport. The available pool is not too bad
Host cancelled the reservation after checkin date time cause big messed on my vacation. VERY NOT WELL PREPARED.

Aaron is a great host
We never recommend this place to anyone
"Kamarnya bersih, lingkungan sekitar apartemen jg bersih, dapur lengkap dengan kompor, microwave, piring dan alat makan lain, kalau ke singapore lg pasti balik kesini. Thanks"
i am a group traveller consisting of four people and it's hard to find a suitable room to fit four people esp in singapore but darrick's place is great! it's very near to bus station but you have to walk for like 7-10 minutes to reach the nearest mrt station (somerset) but it's not a problem for us. room is exactly what i expected (as seen on the picture) and it's very neat. would love to stay in here again
Nice place
"Good option for tourists who just want a place to sleep after touring. The staff allowed us to leave our luggages way before check-in, and allowed us to leave our things even after checking-out so we could do some last minute shopping. Nice beddings and cold air-conditioning!"
Good host. Nice stay!
"busy street outside, if youre taking grab, try to book next street to be safe"
"It was a pleasant stay, the location is great and the room__ clean!"
Derrick's place is easy to find and clean as descripted.
It__ a very comfy place.
"There were 5 of us staying here; we found the place a bit too small for us- for 4 people it__ fine. We would say that if you__e just looking for a place to stay for the night and lie down, not to hang around, then this a great option. Overall, an okay stay with a good location."
Thank you for hosting a nice place. Been staying here 3 times 
OK
"The location is good and convenient especially if you plan to ride buses. Mrt is quite far. 

Staff weren't that friendly and accommodating. 

The room was alright eventhou it's very small. 

Stayed there for 4 days and no cleaning in between."
"a great place to travel with 2-4 people, not too big but have a spacious comfy bed. would recommend using bus instead of mrt since bus station is way closer to the place. i__ consider coming back the next time!"
Nice Place and close to the shuttle bus..
As per my review for each category. Will not book again
"this place is great!!! for family trips to singapore, this is the place."
"The place is clean, though a bit small. About 10-15 mins walk from Somerset MRT Stn, but there is a bus stop in front of the building. The host was helpful and quick in responding to our querries. Overall, it was a nice stay."
"Posto molto centrale e facile da raggiungere con la metro. 
Il locale Ã¨ composto da una stanza e bagno un po_ troppo piccoli e un po_ soffocanti. La mancata possibilit_ di avere/aprire finestre ci Ã¨ un po_ pesata, insieme all__dore di muffa che persisteva nella stanza. 
Ottimo per due giorni a Singapore, non di piÃ¹!"
clean and modern.
"Good place to stay, near bus station"
Tempat dan lokasi nya
"the place is like a residential area. the nearest mrt station is Somerset and it__ still a 15-20 minute walk. however, the bus is really near so if you plan on staying out late, the buses are the excellent way to go home since the mrt closes at around 11pm.

we didn__ meet the host. the staff were okay, some were not that approachable. if you need your room cleaned, you have to ask them first. toilet has no bidet. the room however was clean and has a minimalist style."
We are group of 4 people with 3 night stay. RC was a very responsive host. Overall we are pleased. Will come back for sure !
Nice place will come back again
"Great location. One thing that I wish was more specific was that the one of the queens bed is a mattress on the floor. It isn__ what the photos look like. So it felt a bit cramped. Overall, a convenient location and good communication. We used the bus options more than the subway since the walk was about 10-15 minutes. The bus is right across the Airbnb."
"It has been a good place to live for me and family (4 guests).
The place is near to Bus Station, it makes me easier to go anywhere.
The place is also in the center of the Singapore city.
The room is enough for 4 persons, the toiletries are complete, but only TV wasn't working and already contacted the PIC but not fixed yet till i went home. But, that's not a big issue for me.
Overall, the pictures and the details are just the same with the real one.
I recommend this place for others and will be back here when i go back to Singapore.
Thank you for your hospitality, Rc!"
Excellence!
"A good place to stay if you're on a budget. Easy access to transport. Bed comfy and air  condition helped really well. My other mates were just worried as there were no ventillation and fire exit. Overall, the unit is budget friendly and liveable."
Value for money!
"Spacious space and very clean, position also very near to bus stop ... Recomended !!"
"Extra clean, fast response, excellent amenities. But the room was more packed than I expected _ the room is a bit small for 2 queen bed and the ceiling is a bit low (but not a big thing because we__e mostly going out, and it somehow still comfortable) Excellent location! makes it easy to commute (right in front of bus stop) â­__â­__â­__â­__"
"Place was clean and everything that was described in the picture is what you get. What I really like was the transportation, it is literally in front of a bus stop and 5 to 10 min walk to the train station depending on your pacing. So convenient when you are hopping from place to place. There are also restaurants, small CafÃ© and a  convenient store nearby. Overall, it was a decent place to stay."
The place was much smaller than in the pics.
Worth it!
Had a wonderful stay. The room is clean. The shared kitchen and washing machines are just right outside the room it is very convenient. The location is great too not too far away from malls.
Simply convenient for pax of 4
Its better than i expected! a good place to stay for a moment! fast respond!
Nice place close to NTU
Lovly place
" I could spend very comfortably. This house is very clean and well equipped compared to other places. This room have a big bed and many storage space. There are many food courts around this house, and the shopping center can be reached in about 10 min walk or bus. 
 You will reach NTU by about 5 min walk and 7min bus ride (Totally about 15~20 min including bus waiting). Although it is not a free shuttle bus, there is no problem at all because it is very cheap. If you plan to go to NTU, this house is best. Of course it is also best for sightseeing."
Worth the stay for that price
Very fast response and very clean place however it's not for elderly people or those who has knee or leg issue cause the staircase is really high and steep.
"Small but nice place, great location! Would love to come again in the future!"
"This is my 2nd  stay in this place. The room is very clean and has what I needed. The place is also quiet. Staff is also very helpful, nice and efficient. There is a bus stop nearby that goes to MRT and also to Orchard area."
The place was amazing. The room was so cozy and clean. Highly recommended
Love this place so much. This place also clean and not far with bus station.
"The location is the biggest advantage of this place. That said if you__e ok with a very small bathroom with bathing area as small as that your hands will hit the walls and also with the low ceilings then this is the place for you. Note that to get off the bed you need to slide on the front as there are no space on either sides. 

There was a lizard in the room which was promptly removed by the attendant upon being alerted.  The place could have been cleaner over all."
Great communication from Patricia. Easy check in. Great location. The room was basic but clean. The bed was comfortable!
Good for 2 people but Im so not sure for 3. Not okay if you don__ like small bathroom. But overall great place to stay for this price. Good service and really clean.
"Kitchen : Since it had an open roof concept, dining table and chairs were always wet with rain water. 

- Not suitable for light cooking unless this areas recieves abit of TLC. 

- Water dispenser : The water trickles, so it takes a long time to fill a 500ml bottle of water. But thankful for the free supply of water. It__ a blessing. 

- Bathroom (Room 4A) : It was clean enough but was very tiny. Both my wife and I aren__ big-made people so we managed but anyone tad bit bigger than us will find it very difficult to use the bathroom. 

In general : 

The room and common area is as per the photos, only it looks very rundown in person. definitely needs a little TLC. It would be a sad picture if it__ further neglected.

Check-in was smooth. 

Location and Value : 

- It would be value for money if the points I have made above are addressed and implemented. 

- It__ in an awesome location. I would say The Perfect In comparison to the places I__e stayed in, for the past 8yrs. 

- It__ such a convenient location. 
- 10mins walk to somerset MRT.
- Bus stop is as you step outside of Patricia__ place. 
- 5min walk to a Fair Price store and to many eateries all the way to Penang road. 
- Up scale residential area. 

- Would we book again? YES, but in general the place is worth giving a facelift or be maintained better because it deserves it."
"The place is clean, good location. Minutes of walk from Clarke Quay, Orchard rd and MRT station."
Very convenient place to stay while in singapore!
"Great location, very close to everything and even walking distance. The place is small and could use some renovation. Good price, you are really paying for this place's location."
"Good location, with wifi and air conditioning appreciated."
Good place
good place & location

Nothing to write
Nice
Pat__ room was in an excellent location. The staff was super kind. We would definitely staying in the room again.
"The room was smaller than expected, but was clean. We had an issue with check in as our name wasn__ on the reservation list. We had to wait over half an hour to be let in while waiting for them to contact someone after showing them our booking on the Airbnb app and our confirmation number. No apology was given. Other than that, we had quick responses when we had questions (how to turn on the hot water system) which was great. Also note there is a hole in the shower flooring which means the whole bathroom gets flooded each time anyone takes a shower. The room comes with a washing machine, but no washing detergent/powder. When we asked about it, we were told we had to buy our own. Wasn__ great as we had to buy a whole bottle just to use a tiny bit of it on one load of washing. Would normally expect this to be part of the host__ expense."
"The room was not exactly as shown in the listing (photo seemed to show a room with two beds but that was definitely not the case). However, they were extremely responsive and helpful to right the situation as best they could. I would probably have given this a 2-3 star but the exceptional and fast response redeems it for me. A little far to walk to the MRT station but there is a us stop directly across the street. Would stay here again as it was a good value for the location."

"The place is pretty accurate to the pictures/description. Be aware if you__e tall, the ceiling in our room slanted a bit and was pretty low for half of the room (I__ short so wasn__ a problem for me). Convenient location- only about 10 minutes walk to get to two different mrt lines, or about 15/20 minutes walk into Clarke Quay. All of Singapore felt really safe, and this neighbourhood is no different. Pretty clean, there was hot and cold filtered water in the ground floor kitchen, and also washing machines there. I would probably stay again."
Don't expect hospitality if you're elder and by yourself.
"close to orchard, great location"
thanks pat fr being a great host. bt so high security to use you lift was hard fr me. bt ur rooms are dam good.
The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
è¿__
The place is convenient. The service was ok. AC runs for 12 hours only 7 am- 7 pm. Host should provide additional fan during the hours when ac is not running.
Ann is a very nice host. She took care of me so much in these 2 months I stayed here. We always had good conversation about everything. Gonna miss these days...

Great
"What a convinent students hostel!Nearby the Holland village and the MRT station, I can find lots of delicious foods or travel around with any difficulty."
Nice place to stay when studying in Singapore.
"The place is a bit small but comfortable. The nearest bus stop is about 1 min, and the nearest station is Fort Canning/Sommerset. If you carry a heavy baggage and don__ want to carry them too far, i suggest you use taxi/bus. The assistant is responsive, other staff are nice. Overall it__ recommended for you who need a place to take some rest."
"_beraus nette Leute und hilfsbereit (mussten unser Ticket drucken - kÃ¶nnten es in Lee__ BÃ¼ro machen) manchmal ein wenig ein sonderbarer Geruch im Bad - hatte allerdings mit dem Kanal zu tun - und nachdem jeden Tag mal etwas kÃ¼rzer mal etwas lÃ¤nger regnet, ist das auch kein Wunder. 
Alles in allem, sehr gute Location fÃ¼r sightseeing - sogar zu Fu_. Zimmer etwas klein - aber man ist ja eh nur zum Schlafen da."
The room and bathroom sink are too tight for comfort. Why only 1 chair? My guest had to stand up while eating... :(
If you prefer quite and clean environment then this place is for you
"Location and room is ok. However, there is no one will answer any questions or give any instructions. Not sure if manager was too busy or there is language issue."
"The area is a quick cab ride to anywhere, I feel that it__ a good location. Room floors are a bit dusty due to renovation but very nice aesthetic."
"Clean place, very good location, very friendly host. very small rooms, ac needed repair, repair work was going on in lobby passage."
"Lee was quick to response, gave good tips on how to get around. The easiest way is to take buses to Fort Canning MRT, only two stops away from the apt. Somerset MRT is about 10 mins on foot. Stayed there for 8 nights, so having no window was weird, but since I was mostly out it was ok."
"Small room but price ok , area ok , clean ok"

"Staying here with 2 friends. The room is small. Enough for 2 person, was ok for 3 person. The room is clean. Got hot water and ac. And the extra bed was ok. They dont have toilet spray hose in the toilet. 
The location is near the first killiney kopitiam stall, 24 hours supermarket, bus stop and mall around somerset (the mrt inside the mall)."
My room quite small but enough for 2. Bathroom and bedroom very clean. They have all the basic amenities. Location a bit far from MRT. Bus stop right in from of the house !
"The place is quite nice, strategic location, you can go anywhere by bus. Clean and tide. Will stay here again next visit. Thanks."
_¿é__´é_å¹²å_
"The place is very centrally located, and value for money. You have to do away with certain conveniences, like the place is a walk up, 2nd floor. Small shared Bathrooms. but you can't get anything better at this price. Also Kaurus is very prompt with his responses . Would recommend the place for people looking for private space at value and have an extended stay."
"Exactly what you__ expect, a good sized room, bed I would say is best suited to people under 6 foot 1 inch, I am 6 foot 4 and did have to sleep at an angle, but this is not a fault with the accommodation itself. There is a one-way lock on the bedroom door, so if you want to keep all your possessions safe I would suggest buying a D-lock for the cupboard. Overall a great stay for the price, bathrooms are clean, kettle and refrigerator were available."
"Very straightforward and fast check-in. Flexible host. All amenities are in available in good condition. Common areas are not clean at times but this is more due to other tenants. This price for a short term stay is great value, especially for single room."
Ä° travel around the world and this is one Ä±f the best places i had so far
"Great location, comfortable apartment, easy access to public transport."
"This airbnb is awesome:) 
it was really clean and comfortable.
I spent great time with my kids"
"The house is in good place, MRT is opposite, It is also very convenient to take the bus, Thanks for your detailed introduction to the facilities and explanations of the electrical use and quick reply."
"Great location, it__ very near to Bencoolen MRT, walkable distance to   Dhoby Ghaut MRT and Bugis. Mark is very helpful, good host."
"I was with my family (5 adults and 1 kid).
- Great place.
- It was really clean and comfortable.
-  I spent a great time with my family and kids
- All transport available from this place.
- All the facilities were there.
- My family was happy about staying at such a place. 

Thank you host and thank you Airbnb! :) 5 stars for house and place."
"We often have to do short business trips to Singapore with the family, and Tanya's place was the more spacious apartment we stayed in our 10+ visits to Singapore! We enjoyed it very much.

The apartment was clean, very nice and bright, and perfect for a family. The location is also great, with restaurants downstairs and very close to public transport and to a nice park to go for walks. The person that met us to show the apartment was lovely and very helpful and made our stay much easier. Highly recommended!"
Here is very good place to stay. It's enough to 5 people family. Beds are very confortable. Air conditioners are also installed in each rooms. 2 Bathrooms are confortable too. I recommend this apartment!
"It was an amazing experience staying in Tanya__ apartment. My family loved it as it__ very spacious and every single thing you require was available(bath linens, toiletries, good number of utensils etc. )
Host is very thoughtful in providing all basic necessities to make your stay comfortable.
Location was really great and accessible by all means of transport . 
Bencoolan MRT and Bus stop is just few steps far. Many food court is nearby. China town is at walking distance along with shopping haven Bugis street.
I would recommend this apartment to anyone traveling to Singapore."
"Very good place, appartament clean and spacy"
"Very good location, MRT is 2 minute walk. Little India, Mustafa Center and Bugis market is also at 10 mins walk... Caretaker Mr. Mark is very helpful and gave us all tips for food and shopping places. 
Property has all amenities like rice cooker, plenty of utensils, towels, pillows etc.
Flat is spacious, superclean and 5 people were easily accomodated. Will recommend this Airbnb to everyone"
"Awesome place to stay... So close to shopping and food etc...Couldn't have asked for more.... Check in was super easy and 
Mr Mark met us and showed us all through the apartment... 
Top marks.....supper helpful and great place"
Good location. Two minutes walking to MRT Bencoolen. Many stores for daily needs. Tanya was a great host. Mr Mark was a good caretaker. He guided us to the apartment and helped to settle down in the apartment. We had a great time.

"Our family of 2 grown ups and 2 teen daughters stayed at Tanya's place for 5 days. The flat itself is really nice and spacious and has everything that you need. It is right next to the metro and not far away from the stores if you need anything. We thought that we might use kitchen, but ended up eating out all the time because Singapore has so much to offer! There is an AC in each room which was absolutely fantastic! All in all we really liked our stay and enjoyed out visit to Singapore! Thank you for providing us with such a great accommodation for our visit!"
"Very good stay at Tanya place, good and easy communication. Perfect location and very clean and practical apartment."
"Good location, very central !"
"Pro
- Good location, right in the center, very closed to MRT
- Easy to reach host (assistant), and get respond quickly
- Have everything you need as a home, except food :)

Con
- Access at the rear door, which isn't wheelchair friendly. Got to hand carry luggage, stroller up a few stair steps to get to the small rear door, and access to elevator"
"The location is great and the unit is spacious. The airconditioning works well. 
The wifi is fast. The toilet flush sometimes get stuck and water run continuosly. Have to press again.
Adapter is defective good thing we brought our own travel adapter."
"The hotel is 5 minutes from mrt station and is convenient to go to. There was air conditioner in room every room and was able to stay refreshing. Also, I was grateful that Mark was kind enough to let me check in and check out."
"Nice place located in the heart of the city, very accessible to taxis..buses..MRT.. food courts and market.. Almost complete amenities, your stay feels like that you are staying in your own home..."
Accommodation is very good with all our requirements. I really enjoyed with my family to stay there. Transport also easily available.
Great apartment - listing describes it well. Location excellent near two MRT stations. We were travelling with children & there are about 8 steps to get into the back door up into apartment building but not the end of the world (although wasn__ fun getting luggage up/down them too). It was all clean & bedding was all appropriate. the main bedroom was big enough to just fit a travelcot (we supplied - not the host). We didn__ use much in the kitchen but it was well kitted out.
"Great location at the central area, many eateries and bugis is just walking distance."
Close to public transport
"Good location, 2 mins walk to MRT station or bus stop. 
Spacious place, clean and neat, friendly host. :)"
"The listing made it sound like the pool was included, but the house manager and host do not want you to use the pool. After complaining about this the host did give us access to the pool, but never told us where it is or made us feel welcome."
"Gem of a location and a really  spacious apartment.  Easy access, great air conditioning, and more than enough space for 5 adults.  Thanks heaps."

Tanya__ place is a great location in Singapore for visiting for a family or a group of friends.
"Great location, close to the MRT and an easy walk to the National Museum. We had a great stay!"
Tanya was a great host very responsive with requests.  Mark who met us on arrival was very friendly and showed us around the appartment and to the very nice pool. If you are a light sleeper I do recommend ear plugs they work a treat as it is noisy . Easy short 2 minute walk to MRT to get around singapore sites.  Very comfortable place to stay.
Appartement trÃ¨s bien placÃ© avec tous les Ã©quipement et confort nÃ©cessaire. Fait le job parfaitement.
Great host and the apartment is nice
"Fonderful place.  Near MRT, easy  access.  Everything we needed for a short stay.  Tanya was quick to respond and Mark was very friendly to welcome us and assist us to the apartment."
Great location. Easy access to MRT for all the  tourist places. Plenty of Restaurants shopping malls. We enjoyed our stay.
Great location and amazing host!
"Although we haven__ met Tanya personally, everything was well organised for us.
The apartment is lovely, in a great area and easy to get around.
Would definitely return!"
"The location is awesome, you will find public transports n hip restaurants in a short walk.  The apartment is amazingly cleaned n tidy.  The entrance is a little difficult to find and a few steps to the lobby.  We wish there is luggage storage around the area. I will definitely stay here again."
This is a great location that__ super convenient with access to the Bencoolen MRT to get around. Lots of eateries and several convenience stores within short walking distance.

"Cozy apartment in general. Good location, friendly staff, clean, enough light. But one of the beds squeaks on any little movement."
"Excellent location that sits just outside the heart of the city like Orchard and City Hall. The unit is very clean and Wifi is of excellent speed. We had an AC that was leaking, but it was rectified in no time. Excellent follow-up!"
"Apartment was nice and looked similar to pictures. One of bedsheets  was old, bit dirty and had hole. We were forced to use building backdoor to enter the place. Thank you for having us."
"nice place, good to stay for 4-5 backpackers, tip top clean."
"Found few issues with the apartment. 
1) bedroom had silver fishes handing live or dead in both bed rooms that made us feel living in unhygienic conditions
2) bed linen requires serious uplift
3) bed mattress is way too soft and nearly touches base springs causing bad backs
4) kitchen and bath towels need replacing as it__ way too old 

Overall a good central place but needing it to be maintained specially with items of daily use."
"1. Convenience store located below the apartment and 5mins walk to grocery and get your hunger fixed

2. Extra single bed at living room however need to be gentle as it look very fragile"
A great place to stay. Had a wonderful time.
"Great location. Close to malls, restaurants. MRT right next door. Mark was especially helpful during check-in. Overall great experience."
"This is a great central place to stay. It's an easy walking distance to food and markets. Being fairly central, it's cheap to travel to many places by taxi~$20 for trips to and from the airport, and ~$10 to Marina Bay Sands. 

The place is equipped with everything you'll need during your stay. Mark who met us on arrival was extremely kind and helpful and gave us plenty of quality tips for things to see and do, as well as giving us locations for everything we needed near by. 

We all enjoyed our stay here and we will surely be coming back again. 

Thank you."
"Terrific place to stay _ safe, clean, great location, great communication!

Great host!"
Everything was perfect!
"Slightly worse than expectations. Check in process required a 1 hour call ahead time which resulted in us killing an hour at a coffee shop after a long journey in to Singapore. Place was quite noisy from the bedrooms and we woke up throughout the night. ... the bedrooms are large, kitchen and utilities are useful."
"Good location for sightseeing. MRT station across the road and large shopping areas within a 5minute walk. Taxi to most popular tourist locations is only $5-$10. The two main streets below the apartment get really noisy at night time though with people showing off their cars all night. The apartment is older than appears in the photos but still clean. Just a safety note to young families, the lounge room doors can easily be unlocked and opened by a young child and the railings outside of them are pretty much a ladder. Our 18month old was capable of this. The door to the back balcony was the same. It meant that we literally had to have eyes on both our kids ALL the time in the apartment but we were out most of the day anyhow."
Good for providing washing machine and dryer
"I have nothing but praises for this apartment! Communication with Bob was swift and he answered all my concern and questions. Check in was fast and everyone at the reception, night guard and cleaners are really nice. It was like a home away from home perhaps even better! There is a weekly cleaning service and they do such a fast and great job cleaning the apartment spotless in a short time. We have a small issue with the air con  just 2 days before we check out and it happen at 1am. We called the reception and ask if there is a fan we can borrow for the night while the maintenance come fix the issue the next day, the night guard brought the fan up and even a towel to mop up the water from the air con. And next day the maintenance turn up in the morning and issue with aircon was fox with 15 mins. 

Location was awesome! There a bus stop right outside that takes you to a big mall just 20 mins bus ride away or to the mrt station (Dakota) just 3 bus stop away as well. I was lucky as I had to go to work and it was only 3 mrt station away which is very convienent. The building also have some bike sharing type of bikes so if you download the app you can bike anywhere you want. 

Overall we definitely we coming back to this place. We are gutted we didn__ discover this place before to save us staying at other place! Now we know to not even bother looking at other apartments cos this is the place we will come back to all the time! Thank you Bob and all the lovely staff for such an amazing stay!"
Ticked all the boxes again! Keep it up!
Very reasonable. Good facilities. The apartment is self-contained and has everything that's needed. Could actually cook and do laundry effortlessly.
It's like a home away from home!

Staying at Fortville was amazing. It is very clean and the staff are nice and quick to respond.
Very clean and close to public transport. Train station is a 5 min walk and bus stop is out the front of the apartment.
"Sparkling clean, self-contained, studio apartment at Fort Road. 1 minute walking distance from the Fort Gardens bus stop. MRT is 3 stops away and the nearest MRT is Mountbatten in Circle Line (Yellow Line). The staff out there are thorough professionals and they are very friendly and helpful. I loved my stay at Bob's studio apartment! Will be back soon, for sure!"
"Me and my wife stayed at Bob place and it was a wonderful experience.
Location- pitch perfect with a bus stop just outside apartment. Two 24*7 stores less than 3 min walk.
Appartment- sparkling clean with 3 days a week cleaning, lovely and helpful people at reception.
All basic amenities were provided.
I would definitely recommend this place to everyone and if i visit Singapore again this would be my go to place without a doubt."
"The staff and facilities are excellent and don't be put off by the ""small"" tag, there was plenty of room to get around without tripping over our bags or each other..."
Excelent place to stay. The apartment is exactly in the announcement. I really recommend.
As last time when I visited - everything works. Very good for a longer stay ( above 7 days ) where you want to have your space to cook and stay in.

If you prefer apartment to hotel and a nice calm location close to parks this is definitely the place to go.
"I have stayed here multiple times because of the excellent service, cleanliness, and location. One of my favorite places in Singapore."
"Great location, very clean, host is very prompt."
"The outstanding, single great asset to Kate's apartment is _ at least, for me _ the amazing 30m long lap-pool immediately outside the door on the roof...!  This is a genuine RARETY in Singapore.
The second really cool benefit is that as the apartment is split into two levels and the Guest's room is on the upper floor, the degree of privacy between Hostess and Guest is easily maintained _ especially as there is a separate entrance on this floor which makes comings-and-goings less intrusive for both parties.
Kate is an amenable, courteous and very well-intentioned Hostess who genuinely cares that her visitors have the best possible experience whilst staying in her house _ and is open to listening to any suggestions or requirements that might be voiced.
The amenities are _ as with most things in Singapore _ modern and stylish: so the AC works well, the hot water is abundant and the Wifi is also available _ though, it must be said, that connectivity is a little haphazard due to walls between the Modem and the room. A repeater on the upper landing would probably resolve this issue quite easily.
Because Kate has herself only recently moved in, there is perhaps a lack of a few additional extras that would make the guest a little more ""comfortable"" : such as a table on which to work _ in the space outside of the room and a bedside light _ all of which are ""planned"" and will be imminently available.
The room itself is adequate and for those who like a solid, hard mattress for their backs, will not be disappointed. Apart from the bed, a two-seater lounge offers an alternative space on which to sit.
Geographically, the apartment block is nearer to Changi airport _ a $25 ride _ than it is to those downtown areas that most tourists will like to visit. This isn't really an issue as the MRT station is right next door _ 5 mins away _ and as the service is excellent, there really isn't any issue about getting anywhere using the metro.
However, being not exactly ""central"", a Visitor will need to allow an average of 4 minutes per station plus an addition in-and-out time to any journey if time should be in anyway critical as far as getting to a specific place is concerned. Metro ""card"" is available in the MRT Station Office and the minimum recharge is $10 Sing. The average trip is +/- $2.00. It is recommended to get a free Map from the same MRT Station office as well as download the SIngapore Transport apps which will give the Bus Routes _ as to get to some places will require a combination of MRT Mero and Bus.
Buses and Metro are impeccably clean _ but its often hard to actually find a Trash Can..!!
The electrical wall sockets _ for those who might be interested _ are ""UK-3Pin-styled""  and the voltage is 220v. So bring the right adapter to put in the many sockets available within the room.
That said, I can genuinely say state that my stay was excellent and entirely enjoyable. But again, what really did it for me was the lap-pool: what a BONUS when one has been beaten-down by the day's heat and humidity to come back and enjoy a great swimming workout.
Brilliant...!
Thanks, Kate..!"
Kate is an amazing host.
"The location is great, very near MRT. It is easy to find small restaurants, 27/4 nearby. The bedroom is not so large but space is great too. There are window, airy balcony, swiming pool. Special thanks to Kate for her quick reponses and for her hospitality. I will book Kate__ room if I go to Singapore next times."
"YOU NEED TO SWIM IN KATES POOL!
I enjoyed swimming in a sparkling clean pool (which felt like a small infinity pool) after a long day sight seeing.  The pool very literally is right at your door! Every afternoon I swam I was the only person in there. I also loved the quick on demand hot water in the bathroom and the fact that the shower has one of the Deluge shower heads as well as the standard head.

MRT and many buses are available 2 minutes walk away. I also found the local Hawker Centres good for food and I discovered both a Giant & Shengsiong supermarket about 10 mins walk away but in opposite directions. Shengsiong for me was better equipped.

I can't comment on the Noise & Privacy aspect of Kate's place, since I stayed in Singapore during Chinese New Year, and basically I found that many AirBnBs were lacking the quiet and privacy I wanted, as most hosts had either friends and family staying at their places or at least dropping by. This seems to be the custom and indeed, although I declined, the offer of joining them was extended to me.

So if I wanted to moan about anything, it is that Hosts failed to update their listings during this time to inform their paying guests that others would be staying. My experience was, that after bringing this to the Hosts attention, they tried to compensate for this glitch and indeed this was the case with Kate who made compensation to me for the misunderstanding. Personally I would have been happier with the privacy I was expecting, but Kate listened very respectfully to my feelings on this point, and was quite apologetic and not confrontational. I dare say, had I booked Kate's place at a different time of year when there were no friends or family staying then it would have been quite a private place. This is because as stated by another reviewer, you have your own private entrance and living space upstairs from where Kate herself lives. The two places are divided by the staircase, as you can see in the pictures on the listing. I have suggested a small electric hotplate, a mini fridge and a small table be provided upstairs in the small kitchenette/living area. There is ample room for this.

Kate, as stated by a previous guest, is keen to make continued improvements, and to keep it at a very high standard. Kate welcomes suggestions and so I made some. 

AirBnB's platform/portal could also benefit from suggestions in prompting what detail is needed from both guests and hosts just prior to booking and acceptance. I have written to AirBnB stating what questions should be standard practice before concreting a booking. For the meantime I personally will be sending a template of various more specific questions before I confirm any AirBnB booking. And I urge anyone else who has ideas to really help guests/hosts communicate their requirements prior to booking, to send their ideas to AirBnB. 

So hopefully AirBnB will be as open to suggestions as Kate was, and if all parties slowly implement them then the process, I feel, would minimise conflict at all levels and improve Host/Guest relations.

Kate is a very amiable person and she replied to my initial booking request almost immediately which is quite refreshing. She also gave me early check in and offered me late check out if I wanted it. 

But in conclusion the highlight for me was the pool, and trust me, YOU NEED THIS POOL in Singapore!

Thanks Kate!"
really nice stay! would book again anytime!

Pool area was kept very clean. The private entrance was very convenient especially when coming back really late. The MRT station was also very close by also had lines connecting to down town.

Kate is a wonderfull host with a truely honest approach to making your stay in Singapore a very memorable experience. Having that pool in Singapore is a hug assert that will be well utilised in your time at Kate__ beautiful Villa. I would definitely use Kate place to stay again so easy to get around Singapore and it many attractions.
It was a great experience in the condo and we enjoyed it very much. Nearby (3 min) the MRT Aljunied. Various foodcourts and supermarkets are also very close. And a Durian stall ;-). The room with bathroom is not big but sufficient. Be aware that you are in Singapore and space is tight. And of course the pool. We stayed there 6 nights and with two exceptions we were the only people in this great pool (30 m long and 2.5 metres wide). Also very refreshing after a long walk. We apprectiate also the very quick replies to our messages and your recommendations from Kate. Excellent service at all.

"This place is super because of two things: the pool (a huge plus) and closeness to the metro, which was quite convienient.
Kate is really nice, and she responded quickly to our questions before arrival, Also check in was  nice and smooth,
Rooms are as described, and the pictures are quite accurate. But.....the beds are really nothing good. The master bed could use an extra matrass on top, and - if you need to use the sofa-bed, be aware that it is horrible to sleep on; its not broken (like someone mentioned), its just really bad quality. You can feel all the springs on your back laying down. 
So all in all; allthough it was a nice place, the lack of sleep on the sofabed made our trip a little less good..."
"å¾______¿æ_,ä½__å¾__å¿,äº¤é__ä¾¿å_"
"Kate is a real good host. She is very reactive when you send messages and answer quickly. Good points in that flat are the situation, really close to RTM Aljunied and a lot of very good foodcourts, the amazing swimming pool and the terrace. The flat is ok for a couple or a single person. But if you want to use the tiny living room as a bedroom, you must know that there is no separation between this room and Kate's flat just below (only a staircase in between), so you will have no privacy.
So I recommand the flat if you need only one bedroom."
"Die Erreichbarkeit der MRT ist genial. Innerhalb von rund 20 Minuten ist man an der Bayfront (Marina Sands). Auch der Pool, welcher am Abend eine kleine AbkÃ¼hlung zur heissen Stadt ist, ist super!"
"The apartment is conveniently located 03 to 05 minutes walk from MRT. The Infiniti Pool with jacuzzi and sun deck is a delight. But the apartment had major issues and the unwillingness of Kate to resolve it was a sheer disappointment:
1. Light in bedroom was not functioning which host didn't bother to fix it.
2. Hefty cleaning fee of usd 25 per night but no cleaning offered during the stay. As per host it is cleaning fee after check out. So please make sure you clean the apartment properly before offering to another guest. Strands of hair all around the apartment. The shower cubicle was slippery and dirty.
3. Only two towels provided during entire duration of stay of 05 nights.
4. The drain in the washroom is clogged and water accumulates in the cubicle while using the sink and shower. I am sure public toilets in Singapore are cleaner than what Kate has to offer.
5. Air Con doesn't cool enough, and every night was warm and sweaty.

My recommendation- avoid unless you fancy an infiniti pool"
"Kate is worthy of the name superhost, she's very fast to response, her place is well equipped with the bare essentials for traveler, usb plugs and multi national plugs are readily put  in multiple outlets so if you are a not-so-well-prepared traveler, no worries, Kate is there for the rescue (just don't rely or call her too much cuz well you know, she's not your mama). About the place, is a two-storey loft with a touch of minimal decoration which makes it look very modern and cozy. The place is super close to an MRT Line that runs to the city center and all of city attractions. Around this area, there are plenty of convenience stores, food places and restaurants that open almost 24 hours. All in all, I totally recommend this property for short-stay traveler (one week or under one week). Great place, great host, good value."

Location is near to the train station and some food chains  in the adjacent street. A 711 store is also nearby. Bus stop is also in front of the building. I could consider shortlisting this place for another trip to Singapore.
Kate is really nice host with great communication BUT do not use this appt if you are looking for a two beds accommodation.  The sofabed is also one of the worst sofabeds I had ever sleep and more importantly it is in a very narrow common area which is very nosie every night from the traffic outside and you just could not sleep. The bedroom is OK but the bathroom is really small. We booked 4 nights and had to leave 2 days early and rebooked a hotel to continue our trip.
"Kate ist eine sehr hilfsbereite und herzliche Person. Sie gibt sich sehr MÃ¼he dass sich ihre GÃ¤ste wohl fÃ¼hlen. Dennoch haben wir uns betreffend der Sauberkeit mehr erhofft. Da es im Badezimmer keine LÃ¼ftung gibt, bildet sich leicht Schimmel. Die Dusche war bei Ankunft nicht der Sauberkeit entsprechend, welche ein Schweizer erwartet. Es gab Kalkablagerungen und Schimmel im Badezimmer. Zudem werden Personen mit RÃ¼ckenproblemen auf der Matratze nicht liegen kÃ¶nnen, da man die Federungen deutlich spÃ¼rt. Das Swimmingpool war sauber und jederzeit nutzbar."

Good place great host
Great pool. So close to the MRT station. Great place to eat food Kitty corner from here 24hrs/day. I took my coffee there everyday and and sat and planned my day out. Air con in room or pool are the perfect break from the heat. Would stay here again.

"Tolle Lage mit super Pool

Das Apartment von Kate ist sehr nahe an der MRT-Station Aljuned gelegen (5 Minuten zu Fu_). In der NÃ¤he sind tolle FoodmÃ¤rkte, wo man gÃ¼nstig essen kann. Auch der Pool ist super und perfekt zum lange Bahnen schwimmen. Man schwimmt dabei an vielen kleinen EingÃ¤ngen der Nachbars- Apartments vorbei. Man hat einen direkten Zugang von der Wohnung. 

Das Apartment selbst entspricht den Bildern. Mit Baby war das Bett etwas eng (Baby-Bett war nicht nutzbar) und der Eingang sehr schmal fÃ¼r einen Kinderwagen. Ansonsten ist der Eingang super, da man einen  eigenen Zugang zum 6.stock hat und dort fÃ¼r sich alleine ist. 

Leider war Kate die Zeit nicht da, sondern eine Freundin von ihr. 

Wir wÃ¼rden das nÃ¤chste mal mit Baby lieber etwas mehr Geld bezahlen und in ein Hotel."
Kate is a thoughtful hostess. Quick response. Sparkling cleans. Full privacy
I think somebody is good reputation.
Good location & communication with host. Wifi was not working thou.
"We were cancelled by another Airbnb host 3 days before checkin on 30 Dec. With this short sudden notice near the year end, there were really not a lot of choices with reasonable price. Luckily, we found Alvin place was available for period we stayed. Thanks for his quick response to accept us. The room itself is clean and big. Location is unbeatable, just 1 block from Geylang Road where one can found a lot of local food restaurants or stalls to eat all the day. 2 MRT Lines Green and Yellow station within walking distance, also bus stops nearby, super convenient. Response from Alvin is very quick as well. Highly recommended place to stay in Singapore for me."
"This place is pretty standard. You get a bed, a tv and a private bathroom. I only spent a night here for a last minute stop in Singapore. Even though I got a smoking room, it didn__ smell like cigarettes. It was very clean. Everyone was pleasant and location was great! Alvin was helpful and quick with responses. Everything went great."
Book the room for my guests. Host is very quick when responding. Guests is very satisfied with the place. Will definitely be the first place to find if my guests coming again
Good
I booked and checked in at the same day. They are so responsive. Much better than what im expecting. Free water which i find it sweet. Thanks for letting us stay in your place. Very quiet and very cozy. Comfy and amaizingly clean. I will recomend this to my family and friends. Thanks evergreen.
Good value for the money. Good view to the road comes with the room. Convenient as it is close to a MRT station which helped us to travel around most of Singapore during our trip
Stayed for 5D4N. Great value for money. Near Aljunied MRT Station. New building and quick responses from the host (Alvin).
"Very good value for your money, especially in Singapore! The place was clean, fast wifi and a great location. The Geylang District has a wide array of great food and character. The staff were very accommodating and great to talk to."
Good Apartment
"A place i can recommend for trancient tourist, clean and neat place, it has a good location from mrt station. Staff are very friendly as well as the owner. Thank you."

This is my second time to stay here at Sir Alvin place at Evegreen residences the reason i came back is the cleanliness (they clean your place almost everyday and they have free bottled water)  and safety of the place and the convenience of riding the MTR and bus right then and then even though is a bit near of red light district it is safe....highly recommendable...the staff are all accomodating shout out to her filipina staff ( forgot the name though)  and the owner Sir alvin is very accomodating of all my queries....thanks as well.to the staff who waited us until we arrived at almost past 230am...this place is highly recommendable...

We had a great time. Thanks a million.
The apartment is same as the photos and the location is good for local food and durians. We went back to apartment for relax after 4 to 5 hours traveling under the sun in Singapore. It is a good place for elderly as well
"Apartment in perfect condition 
Clean confortable well located
Top stay!!!!"
It was very close to many durian & fruit stands. There were an overwhelming amount of light switches. There was air con in every room including dining and living which was very nice (especially in this hot weather).
Great place and the host was very helpful =)
Nicest apartment I've ever been in.  The convenience stores connected to the apartment building is a nice bonus.

Excellent value for money. Tree separate bathrooms very useful. Close to the metro station. I recommend staying here.
Great 3 bedroom apartment that could easily fit 6 people just 7mins from train station. Reasonable price and clean too.

"April was very nice, approachable and she responded quickly to my messages. Thank you!"
The host canceled this reservation 82 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

The price is to high is not the value. I felt uncomfortable living there and after one night I__e checked out but I paid for three night fees.
"The room is very nice. Exact the same vs the pic. Lovely view. Easy access to hawker center, durian shop(just around the corner), 711 (downstairs). Place is very quiet. Superb! Highly recommended"
"Tidy place with many amenities  that functions very well! there are also many food choices nearby. The only downside for tourists are that there are no MRT nearby, except from Novena MRT which is 20 mins away by walking distance. The host, April, was friendly and was very quick to respond which made communication super easy."
"Clean and well decorated, it is a really pleasant experience"
Interesting concept of living room and bedroom here. Clean room and good aircon. On the highest floor of Chinatown apartment here right above Chinatown MRT means great convenience and well connected to any part of Singapore. Security on the ground floor offers some friendly security. Plenty of budget-friendly food 24hrs nearby here works for us or anyone. check-in was self-DIY and works well. communications mainly via messaging to host and works pretty well
"Location is central and room is very clean and nice. Laundry on site is amazing as well. My host, Bill, has been very friendly and helpful throughout my stay. Will def come back in the future! Thanks!!"
"A strategic location to stay, easy access (MRT & Bus), easy to find food. 
The building is very old"

10-15 min walking to train stations. Great walking area across Singapore River. Orchard Road is in walking distance too. Easy to get UBER downstairs. 

Shan is really helpful and hospitable. Would like to come back again. Highly recommend to business travelers."
"å¾_,ä¸_è¿_____"
"The apartment is beautiful, and all of the facilities are great. Fantastic walk along the river! Lots of food options and bars nearby. Also walking distant to orchard Road and 5 min driving to CBD. 

And Shan&Xixi are lovely and helpful hosts. Getting to know them is an absolutely bonus. Will definitely return."
"Great location, nice and friendly host, amazing home. Highly recommended for travellers looking to have a comfortable space in Singapore."
"Great host, great location and nice apartment! Will come back again!"
I had a wonderful time at Shan__ place. The flat is outstanding and has a great location.
"Shan is a great host, very kind and helpful. Her flat is great, very clean and location could not be better (the pool is also great!). Central location and walking distance from Somerset MRT station. It is a very good value for the money and I would recommend Shan's apartment for anyone visiting Singapore, either for business or pleasure."
"Shan__ place is very clean, stylish, and organised. Great communication and coordination, had great stay."
Amazing location in Robertson Quay in the heart of Singapore. I stayed at Shan__ for 8 weeks and enjoyed my stay throughout the whole duration. Highly recommend to anyone visiting short-term or long-term!
The place is just simply good. Warm hospitality and nice facilities. A good place for an expat to stay
"Shan was a great host and went out of her way to make me feel welcome. A great location near the  river, with a quiet and large room. Highly recommended!"
"Stay at Shan's place was really great! I stayed about 1month, the unit was always clean, very comfortable with spacious private room, great facilities (nice pool and gym), and as Shan is very friendly I enjoyed my stay a lot! The location is truely in central lots of nice restaurants cafes nearby. Also the unit has nice kitchen so for those who have needs to do some cooking (though no need to do cooking as many food options there), Shan's place is best choice! Shan is very friendly and supportive, made me feel I want to stay longer :)"
"Top! I really had an amazing stay at Shan's apartment in Singapore.
For almost four months, I lived at her cute and lovely place and it couldn't have been better! The apartment is so nice, very clean (as there comes a cleaner once a week), greatly located and just the perfect accommodation for a long-term stay. It totally was home for me, especially as Shan is extremely friendly and a very helpful and lovely host. We lived together with another girl from Germany, what was really amazing. A great friendship started and whenever I am back in Singapore, I will definitely go back to Shan's place. Fully recommended!
Once again, thank you so much for making my stay that awesome! See you soon! :)"

I will book here again when we go back in Singapore.

Again, a very nice stay! Thanks EC!"
"Adequate for a quick stay in the city. Quite far from the train station (about 1km), no convenience store nearby. Privacy is 100 though."
Good place for a budget price

In addition to the price, the location is so convenient that I can go to city area within 15min by bus.
If possible, I__ like to use this next time!Thank you!"
"Good relation quality/quantity. Good MRT communication, about 15 min to downton, bay, etc... very good AC. Nice bathroom"

The room and bathroom are both nice and modern. There is a busstop straight in front of the airbnb and you can reach all the sights easily. We recommend it for a city trip to Singapore.
"EC place is awesome. It is located near the MRT, bus stop is outside the house. There are many buses you can take to go to town. The room and bathroom are spacious. There are shared kitchen and washing machine too if you need to do laundry."
The location is quite good and it__ very easy to be found! The check in guideline that provided by EC is so accurate and clear. The place is so clean too! Bathroom is quite spacious than what we expected! Highly recommended this to everyone! The price is super affordable as well! _ºï_
"This place where you should choose when come Singapore. This room is small but clean, it included tissue, tower, shower,... as 2 star hotel. It is quiet, near MRT station ( about 5 minutes to MRT), near local market (about 10 minutes to there) to eat many good food. The host is very kindly."
"Good place to say a few days in Singapore, a bit small the room but the toilet has good space and in general is all right to stay there, it is close enough to the main places so it__ worth it. Also, the check in very easy, good information in general."
Good location. Functional place. A good price-quality ratio.
Nice
"the place is just few steps from bus stop. it is easy to go wherever you want to go in Singapore. the place was quiet too, the room has very good and spacious bathroom. will definitely recommend this place. 

plus it is a self check in. hassle free if you arrive to singapore at late night or early morning hours."
A good choice for visitors.
The room was nice with a private bathroom and TV. Wifi was great. The check-in process was easy. Supermarkets are quite close. MRT station is in a distance of a short walk along the river.
"The hospitality was great. The room was clean and EC was answering immediately. I think that A/C doesn't work efficiently, but was ok."
"Die Unterkunft ist super gelegen und die Metro ist schnell zu erreichen. Leider gab es ein paar Probleme mit der Feuchtigkeit in den RÃ¤umen, diese wurden aber offen und schnell mit dem Host geklÃ¤rt, von daher bin ich mit dem Vorgang voll zufrieden."

The building is near an express way, so the noise from fast moving vehicles at night could be bothering for some."
"A lovely, clean, modern Singaporean apartment with a friendly and helpful (but unobtrusive) hostess.  I would definetly stay there again if I needed a place in Singapore."
"Evonne is a warm, thoughtful hostess who made me feel very much at home. She made sure I knew she was always available if I needed anything, and offered a lot of helpful tips on getting around. The room itself is very comfortable, with nice lighting, ample air conditioning, closet space, and a giant bed. There was an unexpected sense of privacy, which I thoroughly appreciated. I really enjoyed my experience staying here."
The best host ever! Such a lovely place to stay in Singapore.
Evonne is a very kind host and the house is very nice. Very recommend 
"I had a really good time at Evonne__ lovely place.
I traveled to Singapore by myself and Evonne__ place is really stylish with a central location. The place to accessible through public transport, which I used everyday to get to attractions. 
Evonne is really friendly and offered me wine and a lift to the city.

"Lovely apartment and a very nice host.

Quiet location with easy short inexpensive taxi ride to most attractions or public bus outside the apartment."
"I travelled to Singapore for business and Evonne__ place was just perfect!! Usually I stay in one of the business hotels, but having grown tired of how impersonal, expensive and small they are, I chose this place instead based on the glowing reviews that it has gotten in the past.

Stylishly decorated, homely and very well located (very close to offices / attractions), it is the ideal place for both business and leisure travelers. I didn__ try out the kitchen but the equipment looked impressive. 

It was also great to stay in more local housing, as I got to see a slice of real singaporean life. 

Evonne is a super welcoming and kind host, who is super easy to reach and will make your stay even smoother. She was always offering food and had many local tips for local to-do__. 

I can only recommend this airbnb to travelers!"
"An amazing Airbnb experience, meeting Evonne herself and her friends made my stay just that little more comfortable and personable. It genuinely felt like staying over at a friend__ place with great amenities and appliances with everything that I needed. If you__e looking for a comfortable stay and to interact with local Singaporean__ then this is the ideal place for you!"
"This place is very nice if you want to have a local experience. Evonne is offering more than what__ usual in Singapore. By checking in, I found a huge list of things to do and check out in the area which really helped. I had an own room with huge and comfortable bed. Best accommodation I had in Singapore."
"A real traveller will always try to mingle and stay as locals in every journey they have. Evonne__ place is the real  Singapore. In his apartment, you will surrounded by locals where everyone lives as locals live. She herself is really outstanding, she wasn__ in Singapore on our first 3 days of staying but she always quick on responding our question. Will definitely return in our next visit to singapore"
"A gem of an apartment, found in a central but quiet area. Evonne is an amazing host with a great attitude.
She has compiled hand-written and annotated guides to the apartment and neighborhood. They're super detailed and a lovely personal touch.

The place is incredibly comfy, at the end of each day I was happy to return, relax and re-energize here."
Cozy place and easy to explore Singapore by bus. The guild from Evonne is useful. Quiet neighborhood and local experience. Bathroom is outside the room and sometimes need to share.
"The owner is nice, but I can__ bear that the bath room got a rabbit. It is smelly and made showing difficult."
"Great location and view, Evonne__ perfect assistance, everything like home!"
"- the place is cozy and clean
- king bed
- 50mins bus from the downtown
- hot water is only enough for one person
- almost has everything, and also able to make some simple breakfast
- better to take your own slippers
- the room is right next to the main road, could be a little bit noisy
- good environment
- really convenient, few food stalls and a super market downstairs"
"Evonne's place is clean and tidy and situated in a lovely neighborhood, close to many shops and markets and with quick connections to public transportation to take you downtown.

The view is lovely and Evonne is a great host, always happy to help and speedy with any local tips necessary to enjoy yourself in Singapore.

Definitely recommend!"
"I highly recommend  Eve__ house. She prepared lots of sweet things to us, like the steam oven guideline, cooking recipes... And u also can watch the free Netflix in her house!"
"Evonne was a thoughtful and gracious hostess.  She actually stayed at her mother's home the entire time, which gave us a private home.  Her kitchen is amazing.  It has been years since I was able to cook using a rotisserie - which I did several times during our stay.  She is very kind and thoughtful.  Overall - it was a great stay."
It is located in the red light district in Singapore. But it is also a residential area and is safe to wander around. Not recommend for single girl or traveling with children. Clean place for short stay and it is only 10 mins walk to the MRT.
Good.
Great experience. Recommended. A++

"Chi Siang is super responsive and thoughtful, stocking the fridge with beer and water before we arrived, plus various snacks.  There was a problem with the wifi but he fixed it super quick.    The pool of building seems closed indefinitely, which he told me about once booked.  The pool itself is full of water but taping restricts access due to slope maintenance.   Location is very good...walking distance to multiple mrt stops and food courts plus little India.  The apartment is huge with very comfortable beds.  The couch is not so comfortable so wound up spending most of the time in bed.  Desk is comfortable for working.  Includes toys for kids.  Very thoughtful host.  Very nice place to stay. Thank you!"
Bien placÃ© et fonctionnel
"Goede locatie. Heel veel eetgelegenheden op loopafstand. Appartement is heel schoon, comfortabel en voorzien van alle benodigdheden. Top service."
"We had a great time staying at mr siang__ place for 4days. he provides everything such as mineral water, coffee, snack, others! Save money! 
Great location, District 9 everyone.
He greets us warmly and friendly, Definitely will stay here next time_¤ï_"
"Absolutely loved staying at this property. Very accessible and convenient. 

Mr Siang and his family were extremely courteous to meet and help with whatever is needed. 

I would stay again."

"The village residence is run by Far East Group , well managed by Kay, Everything is good, eating and buying in Hougang 1,  going out by Grab ( Singapore Didi) , the tourists can go Hougang Mall by bus for more choices of eating and buying."
In residential area. Lovely neighbourhood.
"The unit may not be exactly what you see in the pictures due to their different models in the building.  There were no walls or table decor to make the place look cozy.  Cleaning__ service is 3 times a week , very clean and neat but expect bed linens not changed at every service.  The staffs were very friendly and helpful."

Clean room and suitable for couple
"You house is very lovely, livrable, and clean. The bed is very comfortable. It is also convenient since it is located near the MRT and there are many restaurants near it. I am very impressed. Next time, if I come to Singapore, I will definitely consider staying here again."
good local foodcourt at the ground floor
"Jamie is a nice host, and the room she offered is clean. The location of this airbnb is great, walking distance from mrt station. Half an hour traveling time to city center and airport. There is also food court and supermarket downstairs.:)"
Very clean and nice place to stay! Nice host and easy location next to train station.
"We had a great time att Jamies place. The bed was comfortable, the place was clean and not far from downtown. Close to the metro from her place and very easy to get to and from the Airport with the metro also. Jamie is very sweet and easy going and gave us  tip's about what we could see and do. We really recomend her place to other travelers! Thank's again Jamie :)"
"Jamie__ place is really convenient and near town. Lots of food options just below, you__l get to enjoy the Singapore delicacies and culture just by walking around her neighbourhood."
"There are some good reasons to choose this apartment :
1. place close to MRT. (1 minutes)
2. Food center and super market in down stairs. (some of them 24h)
3. good price 
4. Close to airport too. (take MRT less than 45 minutes)

But there are few some bad points for this apartment :
1. You will stay with host in same house and host's room just close to your room so you won't feel really freedom if you would like to have a personal own place house.
2. The communication is not smoothly (not fast and not easy, mostly need to cooperate with host.)
3. The apartment in community. In early morning around 7:00, kids playing noise from down stairs. At night time, some noise from food center too and people singing. 
4. The host house rule is strict even we went back  home very late with our event. We forget few things against the rules and we got blamed by the host. Totally not happy experience for it.

I believe Jamie is a nice person but we feel lots pressure from the host during our stay."
"Jamie's place is a great location! Located right off a MRT (subway) stop and right next to a hawker market, made staying here easy. Jamie was also great about communication and left work to let us in when our flight got in, which we really appreciated. Please note - my sister and I both struggled with sleeping on the bed. The mattress was not very supportive and we woke up with sore backs. Also this apartment is located in a building with many units so there is a lot of neighbor nosie and the walls are pretty thin. I brought ear plugs so it was fine."
Good location to access MRT and also bus stop. Bed mattress is soft and smooth.
"Joel and Eric's place was beyond my expectation. The amenities and facilities are so complete. They also a fast respond host so you shouldn't be worry about asking anything to them, they will respond as soon as they can. Check in and check out are super easy.
A spacious apartment for 4 people, don't worry about the sofa bed, its comfortable enough. Overall I love my stay here!"
"It__ a cosy and quiet place. They were 3 of us occupying the unit. Personally i feel would be cramped if they were 5 occupants.

Checking in and out instructions were very clear and hassle free

Kitchen facilities is well equipped. It also has a big fridge to store drinks, snacks and simple prepared food that can be easily heated up using the microwave.

I especially find the portable wifi hotspot very very useful and convenient. 

Situated in a chic, quiet and safe neighbourhood, just a short walk away from the hustle bustle of orchard road."
"ln general good, only need anti slippery for bathroom & a bit far from mrt"
"Clean, comfortable with a touch of Nanyang style. Awesome pool on the roof floor!"
nyaman
"We had a wonderful stay at Joel__ apartment. He__ always prompt with responding and provides information and help. Check-in was a Breeze. The location of the apartment is superb, we took many walks down to Killiney road for suppers, 24hr supermarket and walked to Orchard, Somerset (the shopping belt). The apartment is clean and comfortable for our family of 4. All in all, I will recommend Joel__ place to stay in Singapore."
"Their place was quite charming in an old converted shophouse! Short 10min walk to Orchard Rd and Somerset MRT station. Fair price grocery was a 5min walk away. Good place to be in proximity to Orchard, but in a nice quiet neighborhood for a peaceful stay. Highly recommended! The kitchenette was a life saver for us trying to save on expenses, plus the laundry I imagine for those staying longer. Joel & Eric were very responsive, and left useful supplies like bath toiletries and even laundry detergent. Highly recommended!"
"It__ a quiet residential place which is just few blocks away from the Orchard. We had a great stay there with good and clean facilities, comfortable for a group of 4. Highly recommend for those who are looking for a central area accommodation with good value"
An accommodating and responsive host.
"Thank you, Joel and Eric, for being such dedicated hosts and for their support throughout the whole trip. The place is super clean, easy to find and centrally located. It is only 5 mins walk to Clarke Quay and the bus station is right outside of the front door. Will definitely come back again and strongly recommend for couple or group of 3."
"The apartment is perfect for a couple who wants to stay for a few days in a great area. It's only about 10 minute walk to Somerset/Orchard Road and there's a grocery store on the way if you want to get some food to eat/drink at home. 10-15 minute walk the other way and you are at another MRT station (or you can take a bus - bus stop is right outside the apartment and to get to the apartment you exit via exit A at the Fort Canning stop and walk a few meters towards the bus stop to your right), it is also a walking distance from Clarke Quay. Highly recommended"

"Stayed 5 nights, 2 adults + 2 Children. Room is very clean and location is convenient. You can walk to  Clarke Quay in 15 min to enjoy food and Singapore night. Swimming pool on the roof is not big but enough to play with my kids. You might feel a bit traffic noise in the mid night but our family got used to in the 2nd night :)"
"Fancy living near Orchard road without paying Orchard road prices, then this place is great. Location is excellent and we hardly used Grab or taxi as buses servicing this area goes to Plaza Singapura, Chinatown, Little India etc. A bus transfer gets you to Vivo City / Sentosa.

Rooftop pool is a bonus which kids enjoyed. Host is extremely responsive. Will I return to stay? Most definitely!"
"The location is fantastic, a short 8 min walk to Somerset MRT and Orchard Road; with a 24 hour supermarket and many wonderful food shops and restaurants nearby. The apartment is also very clean with a queen size bed and a huge sofa bed that can sleep two adults comfortably. The kitchenette is very functional and the bathroom looks like something from a five star hotel. In additional the rooftop swimming pool is also amazing. Check in was a breeze, and the hosts Joel and Tom were very responsive to all my questions.  Thanks guys, I definitely will come back again. Strongly recommended!"
"Accommodation is as described. Hosts are responsive and informative. Location is great. 8-10 min walk to sommerset mrt. Handy convience shopping 5 mins away in fair deal grocery store on Killiney road (on the route to the MRT).
Small Pool is suitable for a quick dip. Supervision required around it for children at all times."
Great place to stay. All amenities were available to make our stay comfortable. The hosts were very responsive. Would recommend it for families too.
"Good place (clean, nice, kind host, location, bus & Mrt nearly) . I will come back for next voy!"
"Excellent location, clean and bright studio that can sleep four adults comfortably, quick responses, no-fuss self check-in.  Highly recommended"
"Joel's place is very clean and nice. The location is great too, just 500m to Somerset or Fort Canning. Would definitely recommend!"
Great place to stay at in Singapore! Nice and clean and in a good area. Transportation was easy with the bus stop right across the building. Only note is that the dryer is in the same machine as the washer and doesn__ really dry the clothes so you would just have to hang them up. Other than that it was a splendid stay! Thanks to Joel for being so accommodating.
Great location but felt the space was small and was best suited to a couple. Our kids enjoyed the pool which was a bonus.
"Excellent location - very close to MRT and FairPrice and all the good eating places - be it hawker centers or high end restaurants at Clark Quay..just walking distance. you don't waste any time for going to any of the popular locations as it is just 15-30 mins max anywhere. We could even take the MRT directly from Changi to the apartment. Joel is really a super-host and he deserves it - very responsive and helpful - taking the WiFi hotspot anywhere saves time and money - as a family of 4 we didn't even got a SIM card - we used the hotspot wherever we went. On the first day we arrived in the afternoon on a hot day, and the AC was not sufficient. Joel offered to get us a small fan. But we realized that it was ok during the mornings and evenings and nights... You can't ask for a better deal in such a fantastic location"
"Convenient location, within 10 mins walking distance to Orchard & MRT station, bus stops right outside the apartment. Also short 5 min walk to the riverside w many nice cafes & popular jogging route. 24hour supermarket nearby, and a row of shophouses selling various cuisines. 
Check in/out process was a breeze, essential info relayed by Joel & Tom timely. Unit is accurately depicted in photos. Towels, soap & shampoo provided. Microwave, washing machine, large fridge w freezer, and induction cooktop w full tableware."
"Great location, very much value for money."
"Easy to checkin with detail explanation. Easy to use utilities, enough space for 4 person since we're out most of the time. Clean towel. Fast response. Well done and thank you Joel"
"Great hospitality, had a little problem and Joel fix it immediately. Good amenities provided in the studio, although a bit noisy at night as the location is next to the main road but still in overall we had a great stay with my 10 months son. Will be back for our next trip."
Joel__ place has super location and in a stylish building. The full street of Kim Yam i found very stylish. Joel and Tom have been very efficient and professional offering check in/out details and responses to all my questions and request. Thank you very much.
Perfect for a couple but a bit too small for 2 seperate people. A little bit of tlc would go a long way. We enjoyed the rooftop pool very much and the location was fantastic.
"Clean and cozy appartment in walking distance from Orchard Road. Bright with some view from large windovs in the corner providing lots of light in to the room. Easy access to ""all ower"". Perfect size for two or two adults and a child. If two adults and two teenaged daugthers like us you have to be good friends... Some traffic noice from River Valey Road, but earplugs secured a good night sleep (three of them). Swift reply on all emails. Would stay again."
"Tom was great host, from the time i booked, everything like check-in, instructions, codes etc. were provided with clarity on time. The room was cozy, clean and well ventilated, we were 4 members including 2 kids aged 10 & 4 and the space was sufficient for us. The property is located extremely in safe neighborhood and close to FairPrice shop which is 5 mins walkable. We can reach orchard central in 10 mins by walk from Tom place. WIFI hotspot was provided and we were able to carry out while roaming the city and stay connected. Only problem i had on my first day was traffic noise from the road since the property is on the main road, entire day we were out visiting the places and when came at night we didn__ face much issues. We thoroughly enjoyed the place and look forward to staying there again."
Joel and Tom are very nice. Great location and very clean room. Enjoyed stay. Highly recommend! ^_^
"Leider hat die Unterkunft nicht ganz unseren Vorstellungen entsprochen. Zum ersten Mal waren wir ein wenig von einer Unterkunft bei Airbnb enttÃ¤uscht. Die Lage war gut und die Kommunikation, sowie das WLAN Modem. Leider war die Unterkunft wirklich nicht sehr sauber. Hatten spÃ¤ter noch eine gÃ¼nstigerer Unterkunft in Singapur, die deutlich besser war."
"Great location close to the city, has all the amenities you need for a stay in Singapore. 10 mins away from the nearest MRT. 

Easy check in with great instructions on how to access the apartment.

Host is quick at getting back to you for any queries you have during your stay."
"We had a great (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication & check in was super quick. The whole place made us feel at ease. The neighborhood is very conveniently located, there's  a supermarket nearby, 15 mins walk to Somerset MRT & less than 5 mins walk to bus stop that brings you to Scotts Rd.  Would absolutely recommend to stay there!"
The place is very central and Somerset mrt is walking distance of 500m. The rooms were clean and almost every taxi Drivers are familiar with the address. The utilities provided are highly sufficient.
"This place was really convenient! Close to the bus stop, MRT, Orchard street shopping, grocery store, and kopitiam. We loved our weeklong stay here and would definitely recommend it!"
Joel is a good host. Response is quick and the apartment is well kept. Family had a relaxed time.
"Joel y Tom estuvieron muy atentos cuando tuvimos un apagÃ³n de luz debido a una Tormenta, respuesta rÃ¡pida y eficaz! La localizaciÃ³n era inmejorable. El espacio es suficiente para 2 personas. Lo Ãºnico a lo que ponemos pega es al ruido de la calle , ya que hay mucho trafico sea de dia que de noche y tambiÃ©n a la limpieza que deberÃ­an de mejorarla bastante (nevera, cubo de la basura, armarios de la cocina, polvo y pelos debajo de las camas)."
Good for the price. Can afford 4 people.
"Well located, good communication, sparkling clean"
This place is very Accessible for roaming around Singapore. Somerset and fort canning stations are very nearby and it's a nice walk to the orchard central. We also used the hotspot which was very handy to find nearest stations. I definitely recommend this place if you are looking to visit Singapore for few days.
"Very easy to check in and check out. Place is very clean and tidy.  For 4 people is ok to stay, if you don__ spend a lot of time in the flat, because space is not very big. Internet hotspot was very helpful, host allowed to take it in the town. Good area to stay, very near is Orchard street. And also pool on the roof was very nice experience, especially in the evening, very beautiful to see all the lights from the top and to swim in the pool. I reccomend this place :)"
Great location. Fast response from Joel. Hassle-free Check in.
"Our stay at Joel__ was everything we needed it to be. There was enough room for 3 girl friends as we literally just used the apartment as a base to sleep.
Internet was good and also useful being able to take it around with you.
It was easy to walk to the main attractions but far enough out that it wasn__ too busy.
The only thing was the road was quite noisy at night so sometimes it was difficult to sleep.
We would recommend to others looking for somewhere reasonable that will spend a lot of time exploring."
Nice place
"Firstly 10 out of 10 to Joel as a host. Clear communication, flexibility and helpful information that made our stay more enjoyable. Secondly, a great location as long as you don't mind short walks as this is half way between Orchard Road and Robinson Quay for the restaurants and relaxation. Both are around 10 - 15 minutes walk away. The apartment is small for a family but better than a hotel room by far. Our only small complaint is that the wifi was slow and we had to go to hotspots off our phone for anything significant. Other than this however, the stay was excellent and we would happily stay here again in the future. It was great value for money."
Joel's place is conveniently located in a quiet building. It has all the amenities you might require and the communication was in time and very effective.
Very nice place! Location is great and the pool on the roof is great fun. Many good eateries around and very close to fort canning park.

"Firstly Joel is special as a host.
Clear communication and helpful information that made our stay more enjoyable.
Location is great, 10-15 minutes walk to Orchard road, to Clarke Quay or to Fort Canning park where there is MRT.
The apartment was very clean with a bed and a sofa that can sleep tree adults comfortably."

"The place is cozy and complete with all amenities. The beds are comfortable to accommodate four people. Our only concern was the AC not cooling the unit as expected. It probably needs some cleaning or changing of filters already. Other than that, our stay here was comfortable and quite near a few good food stalls and a grocery store."
Perfect place to enjoy to Clarke Quay
"Great location, fuss free check in and out, Jon is a very responsive host!"
The host response is quick and friendly
"Clean, prompt and clear communication from the host, easy check in and check out process with no hassle  - all in all a perfect experience and thank you!"
"Jon was an incredible host! He was really responsive and friendly. The place is nice, and location is fantastic! It's a 10-15 minutes walk to Somerset, and many food options nearby. The rooftop pool has an amazing view and a great spot if you're looking to get a tan."
Fast response and nice place
Place is good and cozy. Food places are not far and same goes for groceries. Swimming pool with good view of surroundings too. Would definitely come back. Thank you for the great hospitality
Nice and quiet pl6
Well located bijou apartment. Close and bars and restaurants
The host canceled this reservation 47 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
Nice apartment located near water with thousands of restaurants.  Convenience location and quiet.  Love to stay there.
Jeff's place is in a great location and the apartment is very spacious. There are really nice facilities  (especially the huge pool!) and the building is fairly quiet for those that need some peace and quiet from the busy city. Would definitely stay again.
"Fantastic space! Air Con, amenities such as pool / gym are great, sparkling clean and the location is perfect! 

Jeff welcomed me personally and gave a brief overview of the apartment. 

Two small issues I encountered, minor, though easily resolved. 
Firstly, the freezer didn__ work at all & secondly, I had to download a manual to work out the washing machine. 

No big deal at all, but when staying for a week, fairly necessary. 
Jeff was straight onto rectifying both ASAP, a great response. 

I__ definitely stay, and plan on doing so again."
"My stay at Jeff__ was just awesome. His apartment is a modern property located one street away from the river at Robertson__ Quay, a nice residential area at a stone__ throw from anywhere in the city. Jeff was a cool host, although since everything was so ok I only needed him for checkin :). Highly recommended."
Jeff is a fantastic host and his place is in a fantastic part of Singapore! His local tips were so helpful and if we ever had a question he was always there to answer them.
"Jeff__ place is located in a really great spot- only two minutes from the local yoga studio and great cafes nearby. It was also easy to call a grab (Singapore__ version of Uber) to get anywhere and only a nice 15-20 minutes stroll to orchard road. Apartment is clean, stylish and comfortable for the single or couple travellers. Would definitely recommend! :)"
Host was very friendly and polite! 
"I found this place very spontaneously and they prepared my room as soon as possible.
All worked out great and I got fast responses on my questions.
The place is clean and has everything you need. 
It is very close to the MRT Holland Village.
I enjoyed my stay."
"Great place for students. Location was great, 1 minute from MRT station in Holland village. Food is not a problem in this area. Bedroom and bathroom however, could be cleaner before handover."
"It's  very near from MRT station,shoping mall and Hawker center,so you never have difficalty living.
Moreover,It's very convinient to go to NUS and NUH. I recomend staying this hostel to study at NUH."
"I love this place!
Guys here are really friendly and you can meet guys from all over the world here.
The Holland village mrt station is pretty close to this dorm. And you can find lots of delicious restaurants near here.
I really miss Singapore and the Assemblage. I definitely suggest every student who come to Singapore to live here! It__ definitely worth the money you pay."
"I stayed for 10 days and enjoyed my time. I had a really warm welcome and was surprised by how updated everything is. Depending on what room you get, in can be small but you definitely have all you need. New appliances and it was clean. Also great location and a more than a fair price! Would definitely recommend and come back."
"The place was nice but it would be better if the place was cleaner. I had a bad allergy reaction when I first got there bc of the uncleanliness of the room and bathroom. Found a lot of dust and weird insects on the wall (idk what was it) in my room. Also, the common space was not that clean either."
"Great hospitality and friendly personnel, good location. Flexible check in."
good living room
Good!
Friendly staff. Much better than I expected. Have to climb two flights of stairs to get to it. But it is very good for what it's worth.
"nice ,but some socks and sweaty smell cause the window closed,simple breakfast provided,in the main city area"

"Modern and new unit. Great location next to four different shopping centers (Westgate, JEM, J Cube, and IMM).  Right by MRT station as well. Ground floor unit has a huge patio to enjoy the outdoors and easy access to pool.   Host is very accessible and responsive.  Great service.  We were very pleased with our entire experience."
"Generell eine gute Adresse, wenn man low Budget unterwegs ist und nicht allzu hohe AnsprÃ¼che an ein Zimmer hat."
"The location is great, the host was accommodating to our early check-in request, and there was toast with peanut butter or jam for breakfast. The place also has laundry, computers, and a hairdryer. My only complaint is that the outlet above my bed did not work so my phone didn__ get charged."
Will book once again
"Hostel, you will be dealing with different personality and culture so respect one another"
"Despite being a hostel that cram a lot of people in such limited space, it is actually very quiet and clean.

Housekeepers and receptionists are all very welcoming and kind."
"very accommodating , especially with late check out. able to keep bags in storage in the afternoon, and come back for a shower"
"Location is great!  Receptionist was friendly and efficient. Not for light sleeper. Noise from outside could be heard clearly.  Beds squeak when turning or moving on it.  Guest brought male to female dormitory at 1am plus and wearing shoes into the room. Could hear sound made by lady__ shoes when she__ walking around. Although she whispered, it__ disturbing."
"The host relocated us without sufficient discussion and appropriate solution, but they did refund as we asked to cancel the second night"
Spend more money and go somewhere nicer. Rooms smell bad. Window doesnt fully shut. I ordered a female dorm then when we got there they said it was fully booked but theyd put me in a mixed cause i already payed. There was 2 toilets and 2 showers for over 50 people and i was sick so we just left 5 mins after getting their and they wouldnt refund me anything... the desk lady seemed nice. And at least they responded to me and told me they weren't going to refund me so they were responsive i guess.
I made a mistake but they just refund me no problem
Exceptional host. Very well maintained place and in the heart of the city. It__ just a stones throw away from the places you must visited in Singapore. This experience has left me satisfied when I look back on my visit to Singapore. Thank you to the host for making my stay comfortable. Wish her the best!
"Highly recommend for business travel & long term stay which requires privacy and comfortable working area. 

The room is much better and spacious than the picture!! Lovely sunlight while lying on the bed reading. Truly enjoyed my time working in front of the table and looking at greenery outside. 

The apartment is beautiful and have all things you will need. Swimming pool is big and not crowed at all. River is just downstairs, walking along it is fun and relaxed. It__ located in the heart of the city, very convenient to go anywhere, and lots of restaurants options."
"Very spacious room with great sunlight during daytime. The super-single bed is just nice for 1 person. 

The apartment is beautiful, clean and centrally located. Very convenient to supermarkets, shopping malls and restaurants & bars. Also walking distance to China town, where you can find lots of local food at very attractive price. 

Shan is a great host. Whenever I need help she is always there. Would like to recommend her room to others! Wish to come back again!"
"Shan is great host and I love her place. It__ in very nice location, mins to walk to the river with a lot of nice coffee shop and restaurants. The apt is very clean with all kitchen stuff more than needed. It__ so convinient and I felt home when I stayed. Highly recomended."
"Das ist ja eine wirklich perfekte Unterkunft. Alles ordentlich und sauber. Obwohl der Ort zum Einkauf praktisch ist, kann man wirklich beim Schlafen Ruhe genie_en. Au_erdem gibts sogar Fitnessstudio und Schwimmpool!! Das war eine echt geile Erfahrung, und kann nur empfehlen!"
"Nicely renovated and comfy room for one or two people. Communications has been seamless and prompt. 

The location is central and close to MRT, shopping centers - Orchad, Marina Bay Sands, Suntec and other amenities. There are plenty of eateries and bars downstairs and surround. 

Will definitely return when I__ traveling to Singapore."
Very fantastic location.. clean.. especially the hosts Shan&Xixi..They really made me feel like home.. Must stay!!
"Shan's place is perfect. It is quiet and the chill moments on the balcony were my favorites. I loved to start the day with a run along the river. The gym and the pool are also nice and great options for sportive. Wherever you have to go to, it's in walking distance. The next MRT is also nearby. Even to go clubbing is in walking distance not to forget about all the food options to eat out, bing in or take away. The bedroom is no huge but big enough to feel comfortable. It comes with a desk and a closet. I felt comfortable, also when working from home. Note that many co-working places are nearby, if you need a place to get inspired. To sum it up, a very nice, clean, light-flooded apartment in the middle of the city, where you feel welcome and home. Enjoy!"
"It is a nice condo, very well located, easily accessible to the downtown. The building has a very good pool and it is just next to the river for pleasant evening walks. Highly recommend it"
My second time at Shans place and it was perfect as at the first time. Shan is a great host and the appartment very well located. I really recommend!
"I love this place. The best location, the house is very good and I will definitely come back every time I visit Singapore. I recommend everyone to this amazing Airbnb apartment. I love it."
"Shan's place is amazing. It's Very clean, easy to get to everywhere, the neighborhood is relaxing. Shan is very caring too! When I wasn't shown up for a few days, she texted me if I was OK. For a person who had a bad Airbnb experience like me her place is just perfect option to choose."
"The location is great, a few strides from all the river where all the bars/ restaurants are located. A few excellent cafes just next door as well.
Condo is good with large pool and decent gym. 
Small apartment with shared bathroom but nice enough for a single person for a few weeks"
"During the 1 month stay, Shan has been kind and helpful as a host. 

The apartment itself is not huge but still spacey and homey. The kitchen and in-house washer&dryer were very nice especially since I didn't have much time to eat out and go to laundromat during weekdays.  My favorite corner was the lounging area on the balcony, which you could look down directly to the pool and see the beautiful view of the surrounding area during sunset! 

Be mindful that the total price in airbnb hasn't included weekly cleaning fee (which will be discussed with Shan later on). However, for such a price, Shan's listing is definitely the right place to stay if you come to Singapore for work!"
"Tolle Wohnung in eine gute Umgebung. Shan war ein super Host. Ich werde dieser Wohnung empfehlen und ich werde nochmal in dieser Wohnung Ã¼bernachten, falls ich zurÃ¼ck in Singapur komme."
"I can highly recommend Shans place!! 
I had such a great time there. The apartment is always clean and the condo, especially the pool, is amazing!:) 
Shan is a very friendly and open person and I had a good time with her! :) 
I would definitely come back to this place!!"
I like the cleanliness and the big flow water in the bathroom. Wish they provide free flow drinking dispenser. Close to bus station and 10_ walk to mrt.
Fantastic location and cleanliness! James was very responsive and polite during the whole process. Easy check in/check out and great amenities in the house. You have everything you need and don__ have to worry about anything. Highly recommended! Thank you for being such a great host!
Thank you very much for the stay James.  It is a great condo and I definitely made the most of the huge pool during my stay.  There is an amazing view over the city and it is very easy to get around Singapore with metro and bus close by.  Lots of good restaurants around as well.  Would definitely book again if I come back to Singapore.
"It is a great place to stay! I enjoyed my time very much! The apartment is very modern and bigger than I thought from the pictures. the bathroom has an awesome shower and in the bedroom is a nice walk in wardrobe. James always quickly answered to any inquiry.

Also the pool and gym are great facilities which I should have used more...

Highly recommended to stay there!"
Great stay!!
Another great stay at James's place.  Many thanks!
"Our stay in James' apartments was awesome!
Apartments: new building, new furniture, total cleanness.
Location: right near conservation area of Arab st and close to 3 MRT stations: Bugis and Nicolle Highway
Hospitality: punctual, helpful and no disturbance at all!

Thanks a lot!"
"We (30's couple) stayed more than one month at James's flat. This condo is quite new and descent. The room is also very clean and well equipped with brand-new appliances. Water pressure is enough strong, and no issues on the sink and toilet. Although the shopping mall in basement has a few option for meals, there are plenty of choices of local restaurants and bars around the condo. A local mini-mart is located just across the street, so you can buy most of stuff there. Lots of bus stops are available to anywhere in Singapore.
James is very responsive and flexible for our requests.  When I text to him, the response was always in hours. No issues on check-in and check-out. He made our stay very confortable. Highly recommended place!!"
Great little place in an amazing location with a great view in one of Singapore__ newest condo__. James is a great host.
"Stayed before,repeated guest. The place is always upgrading to improve the condition of the house. It is very well kept! Recommend to everyone"
"Awesome experience. Must try for those who want a different experience. First time living on a boat, which was much more luxurious than expected. The location is great as well, very romantic. Great get-away from Singapore city life. Would highly recommend people to try it"
"Jo__ place is a treasure that I happened to find when searching for some time out from singapore bustling city life. Her boat is accessible, clean but offers you a unique sanctuary from singapores city life. Located in Sentosa cove her boat has all the creature comforts you would expect and more for a peaceful and romantic getaway. Definitely reccommend."

Great hospitality. Excellent host. Flexible with timings etc. You get more than what you expect including the facilities at OneMarina15.  It__ a cozy yacht perfect for solo or couple travellers. Lionel gave a good crash course on the basic things we need to know. My favourite would have to be the deck. Lay down there till 3am. With the cold Breeze and Super bright moon. Superb experience! Jo is so lovely and humble! Will definitely be back! Thank you again!
"Jo is a very passionate and helping for our trip. She makes the check in very easy and detailed. We even rush before happy hour to get a free drink. She offers all kind of help that you can never imagine including telling you how to stretch your back muscle, hahahaha"
"Definitely the best staycation I ever had! The experience was totally out of the ordinary and worth it! Please do take a leap of faith and go for it to try living on the boat! Also special shoutout to such great hosts Josephine and Lionel who really showed us around and ensure all the safety aspects and things we need to know was covered! Beautiful people, wonderful stay, amazing experience as a whole!!"
"We, me and my friend, Gavin who is from the UK, had the most beautiful time spent at Jo's place.

We were given excellent guidance since the very beginning even before our booking. It was extremely amazing! Josephine and Lionel were going the extra miles by guiding us from head to toe, which we have never come acrossed with any host from Airbnb! 

We are truly blessed to have met the wonderful souls - Josephine and Lionel. I will definitely come back again with recommending few of my great soul mates."
We had such a comfortable and relaxing stay for 2. Jo and Lionel take such good care of their boat and ensure you have all you need for the stay! Hope to be back! :)

"Boat is clean and spacious. The audio system is of good quality, we had an enjoyable time listening to radio on deck, watching our favorite movie in boat.  The entire experience is unique and comfortable. The host, Lionel, spend much of his time chit chatting with us, sharing his passion for the boat n the sea.  This adds to our special memories of our short staycation:)"
A different kind of staycation and birthday celebration. Would recommend to families and friends!
"If you want a vacation to remember, Jo's boat is definitely the way to go. I didn't want to stay in a hotel in Sentosa and that was the best decision. The boat was spacious for two people and extremely comfortable. Had one of the most uninterrupted good night's sleep in ages.

Best of all was the deck, where we spent the evening chilling out on with some wine and fruit.

Jo and her husband both met us for the check in process and are the most hospitable hosts. Great night, highly recommended!!"
"ç¡___ä¸_ä¸_____éª,ç¬_å¤©ç__£æ_æ²__å¸¸æ_ä¾¿ï½¡"
"If you're looking for a unique staycation to remember then look no further. I'm so glad I found this! Lionel and Jo were incredible hosts from being patient and friendly with my queries to guiding us on the dos and don'ts on the boat. The boat was clean, comfortable and better than expected. We all had a very good night's sleep. Our highlight was definitely sitting on the deck and looking out to view the stars.

I would also like to point out the kind hospitality that the hosts have displayed from providing complimentary coffee and tea, slippers and even cables to charge your electronic devices. When they knew we were going for a run, they even left us bananas. So sweet!

If you've always wanted to know what it's like to stay on a boat, then don't miss this chance."
Amazing stay at the yatch. Celebrated my birthday here and this unique experience made it very special. Awesome guests and impeccable services. Highly recommended!
"Both Josephine and Lionel were very helpful in making our yacht stay as comfortable as possible. We had a great deal of time exploring the boat and the surroundings in One Degree 15. 

As staying in a yacht is an altogether different experience, we are very thankful that the hosts are very patient in giving us instructions on operating the lights and appliances inside.

The place is also squeaky-clean and well-maintained. We also had a superb view outside with all the other yachts and stars.

100% we would like to go back and stay again for our vacation!"
"Jo and Lionel were the most gracious, friendly and unforgettable hosts I have ever had the honour to meet. They were extremely prompt and upfront with communication before, during and after the stay. They have endless stories about the amazing lives they have lived and their lovely kids. 

Now, to the space. You will never find another Airbnb that leaves such a deep mark on you, causing you to think about when you'll be back  the moment you step off this boat. The boat has two bedrooms, a full couch inside, a sitting area outside, and an entire front deck to chill and watch the stars. It's impeccably clean and tastefully furnished. The a/c is plenty cold, but chances are you won't need it with the cool night sea breeze coming in. The gentle sway of the boat docked in the marina will give you the best sleep you've had in months (or if you're like me, years). 

As much as I hate to say this (for fear of Jo and Lionel's boat gaining popularity and reducing my chances of going back), do it, book it. You won't regret it. There's really no other Airbnb experience in Singapore like this."
"Jo__ place is a really great find. It was the perfect staycation for my Husband and I. Jo and her Husband provided great tips and were prompt to respond to our requests. They were very friendly.

The boat is very clean and equipped with amenities (though it is definitely recommended to not cook and take the chance to relax). The deck provided a great place for relaxation. Star grazing at night while enjoying the night Breeze definitely made the experience greater. The sound system is great as well."

"It was an amazing experience. My boyfriend and I loved it. Jo and Lionel are extremely friendly and accommodating. They were really patient with explaining the details of the boat and showing us the facilities around the boat to ensure that we get the most out of our stay. I highly recommend everyone, especially couples, to enjoy this lovely and luxurious experience. Thank you, Jo and Lionel! :-)"
"I wish had more days to stay in boat, it was amazing experience felt like I__ a kid and sleeping in crib. 
Jo and Josephine are great host they guide us to local market and there place is really close from Vivo City, Sentosa, Universal Studio and food Hawker Center.
The good thing is you can commute to these place without paying any penny using the bus service which is free.
From Sentosa you can get MRT which is a local transport system and doesn__ cost a lot.
Singapore is beautiful if you found nice place and good host to stay with you will enjoy."
"Jo and Lionel are wonderful hosts who are very generous with their sharing and has kept their place clean and comfortable. Overall, it was a great experience which is highly recommended."
"Josephine and Lionel were really friendly and showed us around thoroughly. Yacht was clean and spacious, will be back again :)"

"We strongly recommend Jo and Lionel's place for the grt stay on their splendid yacht. Enjoy the night sea breeze with a view of sun rise and sun set when the weather is good!
They are being an awesome host.thank you!"
"We had an amazing experience staying in josephines place. glad we stumbled upon this lovely boat. Josephine is very attentive and accomodating. she took time in explaining to us all the equipments inside the boat, she even gave us tips on where to go and where to eat. we really had a wonderful time and we'll gladly book again :)"
Don__ have second thoughts! Book it! The place and the owners are awesome. Highly recommended :) will book again soon!
"Jo's place is a gem, with Lionel being a very caring and kind host. Sentosa Cove and the boat are beautiful. Recommend!"
"The place was amazing and really unique, a great place to stay if you want to unwind and enjoy the beautiful Seabreeze and sunrises. The hospitality from the hosts were amazing, even though we checked in a little late, they still took the time to explain everything we needed to know about the boat, and even suggestions on where we can have breakfast, and what we could do while staying here. The rooms were really clean and well, with a fridge that__ well stocked with beverages, it would really save all of us the trouble of going out to get more if we need. It__ also located quite near 7/11 and cold storage, making it really convenient for all of us. Overall we enjoyed our stay at this lovely place and would definitely consider coming back here again."
"Jo__ place is definitely a must-try if you__e looking for something cosy, private and experiential! Actual stay is true to the photos and Lionel was very patient when it comes to explaining the functions of the boat/switches/etc. Lovely couple to chat with as well! Love the stay!"
The yacht was clean and everything was provided for us! Josephine & Lionel were great hosts who ensured that everything was good for us. It was a great and the most unique staycation experience we've had! :)
"Jo's Place is awesome and unique sight to travelers. Staying at the Yacht in Sentosa island  of Singapore is very safe and relax. The host Josephine and Lionel  are very attentive couple and great communication to provide all information, kinds of amenities, kitchen facilities. One can use the pool with towels, gym and library at free of charge. 
Highly recommend Jo's  Place for short stay in Singapore."
Nice yacht and wonderful experience staying on a yacht.  May need some time to get used to the rocking sensation though. Highly recommended
"Place is clean and easy to locate, Jo & Lionel helps us out everything we need and accommodates to all our timings, explains everything about the yacht patiently and we felt so assured and knows how to handle the yacht. Loved falling asleep amongst the soft sways of the sea. A very pleasant experience for my boyfriend & I! We would wanna stay longer if we can but the place is booked every single day there__ no more 2 days in a row for us to choose. Strongly recommend this for a whole different Airbnb/staycay experience! Loved it!"
"Jo's place was an awesome experience. We were greeted by Lionel who was friendly and took his time to go through everything we needed to know. He and his wife were easy to contact throughout the stay in case we had any questions.
The boat itself is really comfortable, with both outdoor and indoor spaces to enjoy, and it is in a beautiful setting. 
Having access to the marina facilities is definitely a bonus, and you will find everything you need within short walking distance, including a well stocked supermarket, 7-11, restaurants, and free buses to get around Sentosa. The beaches aren't too far either. 
Have drinks on your own private deck, or just lie down and look at the stars before being rocked to sleep by the gentle waves. 
This is definitely a special experience in Singapore and it was a relaxing end to our holiday, before a busy work week. I would absolutely recommend it!"
"Amazing stay at Joes place.  Much better than expected. Great location very clean. Really great experience to stay on the boat, i can only recommend all to try that, also access to the yacht club where you can relax at the swimming pool take a sauna bath and so on. Best value for money. The Host was also very friendly explaining all details giving us tips for trips. I will definitely come again!! Thanks for the good time"
"My husband and I are absolutely happy with our stay. Jo and Lionel were very accomodating. They even initiated to take a picture of us. I felt shy at first having the owners do it for us but, they are very humble to share such a good experience with us. Lionel even gave his cap to my husband for souveneir. Every thing was worth it. The facilities, the view, the environment were all awesome. Every penny is worth it. If you want to destress, just like us, this is a perfect way of doing it. Book your stay here instead of hotel rooms. There__ so much more to see and to do. God bless you more, Jo and Lionel for such a kind heart. You__e let us experience a unique stay with a reasonable price. Thank you for entrusting your yacht to us for a night. We took care of it. _¤ï_"
"Everything about the stay was amazing. The boat, cleanliness, view at night, ammenities and nearby food were nothing but amazing. Definitely a good value for money, and would consider staying again in the future!"
"Nice view,nice location,cold storage and 7-11 near by,nearest restaurant price reasonable,Josephine and Lione are very nice ,good experience for us "
"Thank Jo & Mr.Lopez so much for the memorial experience living on ship, the ship is very clean and have the beautiful view."
"Our stay at Jo__ place was really a wonderful experience! Jo and Lionel were quick to respond and were very friendly to share with us their experiences. If you__e looking for a therapeutic getaway, this is the place to go! The most peaceful and quietest stay ever. Thank you very much Jo and Lionel for everything!"
"Spectacular! I wasn't sure if it as the lure of falling asleep under the stars in a serene setting, the convenience of the local restaurants, the ability to be away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life or the romance of a candle light experience out on the ocean with someone you love.  Thanks guys for making this a not only amazing stay but a wonderful experience!"
"Amazing boat stay. Both of us slept like babies as the boat just swayed gently all night. Rocking indeed helped us sleep well I must say. 
Really recommend to anyone seeking a relaxing stay! 
Also, Jo is an wonderful host. Not only did she help us get to know all the safety rules thoroughly, she also helped us take beautiful pics on her boat haha. 
Views around are nice. Laying on the deck and chatting with your loved ones are just too much more than I could ask for. Recommend this place especially for couples!"
Thank you is not enough to express the gratitude I have for both Lionel and Jo. They it is an A plus for effort. I had a wonderful experience and it's definitely a place to come back to. Highly recommended
Jo's place is definitely a must try accomodation experience. Boat is clean and well maintained. The hosts are very hospitable and friendly. Going around sentosa from the boat is free and covenient.
"The host was great. Lionel explained very clearly all the details n instructions about the boat. 

Perfect getaway from the bustling city. Place was clean and very comfortable. Would love to come back again "
We really had an amazing stay and Lionel was really helpful and super friendly. Thanks for the great time.
"An incredible stay within Sentosa, I cant imagine a more fun and unique place to spend a few days while in the south of Singapore. You have to experience it! Jo and Lionell were incredibly accommodating hosts and super responsive."
"When choosing to stay in Sentosa, do yourself a favour and stay in this boat. Well-recommended for couples. Will come back again to be lulled to sleep and hear the therapeutic water and relaxing scenery. :)"
"Jo__ place is simply an amazing experience. It__ akin to owning a boat and living on a boat. 

We were created by the host in our arrival and was given a good briefing that enable us to know how everything functions well. 

We had an amazing stay and an even better dinner together. Could lay on the decks viewing the skies and resting. 

The rocking of the boat is so therapeutic! We enjoy it."
"This was magnificent.  The boat,  the view,  location....  I could really go on forever.  You would be foolish not stay here.  It was quite lovely.  Lionel was an outstanding host.  His boat was well equipped as well for any needs.  I was left speechless!  Thank you!  We hope to see you soon!!!"
Jo and Lionel had been very patient to have waited for us to arrive. Thanks for the local tips and hospitality. It's been great meeting you guys!
"Estupendo! Era lugar muy bueno, ellos eran muy amable tambiÃ©n. Nos gustan muchas en su ""casa""."
A unique stay and was very peaceful falling asleep to the gentle rocking of the boat and water. Was a short walk away from a supermarket and some nice restaurants for meals. Lionel was most helpful explaining everything during check in and great meeting Jo for a chat during the check out.

Thanks you jo and lionel for great hospitality and great yatch.we hope can coming soon to your luxury yatch.great holiday.
"Amazing boat experience, if you are looking for one, this is hard to beat."
Very nice place to chill out and enjoy being over seas without bringing your passport
"A great weekend getaway in Singapore. From the moment we booked the communication was excellent. We enjoyed sipping beers and reading our books as the sunset over the boat. Such a lovely way to spend a weekend, I would definitely recommend and hope to stay again soon. Thank you Jo and Lionel!"
We had a great time at Jo__ place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. Would absolutely recommend this place to everyone!
Better than expected! Comfortable place for hanging out purposes.
It was a really enjoyable stay being on the boat! Would highly recommend to my friends and family.
Great experience! The amenities inside the boat were amazing and everything needed was available. Would definitely recommend these hosts :)
Jo and Lionel are nice friendly people. They show great hospitality. We hope to be back.
It was excellent. Lionel was hospitable; the place was clean and comfortable.
Thanks good host
A wonderful unique get away apart from the hustle of Singapore.
"Such an amazing experience. Rented the boat for my boyfriend__ birthday, and he had the time of his life. Location was great, very serene and picturesque. Definitely would book again. Host Jo was very accommodating and nice. 10/10 would recommend!"
"Great hosts, many thanks for looking after us!"
Generally a fair value to have an experience on a yacht. Lionel is very responsive and have a pleasant character. Good for couples who found hotel or resort are way too boring. Bring your own drinking water might be a good tips.
"The boat is wonderful and cozy place to stay and chill. It is well maintained. The location has many convenient eateries nearby. Host is very nice, humble and patient."
Jo & Lionel are very warm and friendly and we really appreciate the superb hospitality we__e experienced. It was a very comfortable stay on the yacht and we are thankful for the comprehensive check-in procedures and prompt responses by Jo & Lionel. The yacht is fully equipped and it felt very homely - it was definitely a worthwhile stay!
Interesting stay if you are keen on a night of camping on the sea. The stay comes with a list of 'to do' and 'not to do' so be prepared for it. There are CCTV cameras in the front and back of the boat (probably for insurance reasons) however it does leave you with a feeling of being watched all the time. There is a really nice bike path around the Marina so worth bringing your bikes or you can rent one in the shop in the Marina.
"Helped my brother organize his proposal here. The boat at sunset was very beautiful, and Jo and Lionel were very helpful and clear in their communication. Thank you for helping us create unique memories!"
Hosts were super accomodating. The boat was very clean. Sleep was very comfortable. Bars & fishing/prawning place is not even far at all. Not to mention for the hosts were very responsive and helpful. Stargazing on the deck is spectacular. It was peaceful too. It was an amazing experience & I will definitely be back!
interesting experience!
Hermoso lugar para relajarse viendo las estrellas. Los vinos increÃ­bles y a muy buen precio! _¤ï_
"Excellent choice, won__ regret!"
My boyfriend and I enjoyed our two nights in board of Jo and Lionel__ yacht. It__ an interesting getaway.
"The owners really care about the boat and their guests and it shows in how well the boat is kept up. It was really nice that Jo and Lionel were there to greet us and help us get familiar with the boat when we arrived and to see us off. They offered a lot of great tips for what to do in the area and ensured the place was clean and ready for us when we arrived. The entire vibe of the stay was comfortable and relaxing, which is exactly what we were hoping for. We would recommend this stay to our friends and would happily do it again in the future."
Stayed at jo's place and had a wonderful time. Watching a movie under the nightsky on the boat deck was surreal experience.
It was a great experience staying at the yatch and Jo & Lionel are friendly hist. They will explain everything clearly to you before your stay. Im glad that i've made a choice to stay here for my bday staycation.
"The Marina Country Club in Punggol has a  few different options for dining and nightlife but overall the location is very relaxed. And the local community are very helpful and friendly.

The communication with Jo & Lionel was great and very easy.

The boat itself is well maintained and decently sized and very comfortable for  a couple, and is fitted out with all appliances and equipment that you might need during your stay.

It was a great place to be able to sit on deck and relax for a couple of days watching the World go by!"
"A unique stay. Jo and Lionel weren__ there to welcome me but their son Hugo was there and it shows they love their boat and its great that they give an opportunity to share the love.

The briefing was thorough and the boat is very clean. Its shown that they care for us too as they are there to answer any enquiries. There is a prawning place, bars and restaurants close by. Overall I__ happy with he experience."
The check-in process was smooth with thorough explanation about the Yacht in & out. Check-out process was straight forward too. Sufficient necessities provided. There are great eateries nearby.
By far the best birthday I ever had... polite and friendly service. Everything was prepared and willing to go extra for us.. everyone should at least try once...
Spent about 4 hrs there - very light use. Neat and clean Yatch.
"Always reachable, boat is very clean."
Interesting experience.
Great place
Very quick response..  Owner was super2 friendly..  No hesitation for another go.. I would love to recommend u alls to give it a try..  Great experience..
Jo & Lionel were very hospitable and friendly! The yacht was really clean and it is indeed a unique staycation experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the peaceful time that I had sitting at the deck of the boat just chatting and gazing into the night sky. Would highly recommend anyone looking for a unique staycation experience!
Amazing experience!! Very nice yatch!
"Experience at the boat to enjoy the sunset , hearing the waters , birds chirping and seeing birds flying across the sea is really enjoyable. If you would like to have some quiet time reading or praying , this is definitely a place you can reside in. I like the fact that it has no wifi giving me time of rest from the busyness and enjoying the nature. You can prepare your own breakfast , lunch and dinner and enjoyed it on the deck. If you are a reader like me , this is where you can read a book on the deck under the sky. I also manage to do some work and have zoom meeting on the boat with my phone data which made it very productive. A place  of retreat and place to relax."
"Wife enjoyed celebrating double date birthday on the boat, midnight stargazing from the boat deck at seaside jetty, also having our seafood dinner packed from nearby restaurant on the floating boat with sea breeze, ocean view and sound of waves was perfect for a memorable private stay. Plan your itinerary in prior with additional time if you have to organise an event with decorations to be done, there will be a thorough check-in briefing by host to explain how to use the functions on the boat, briefing for about an hour max which is fair enough as the maintenance of the boat is expensive and not everyone are used to living on luxury equipped boat. We left to a nearby mall to get cake and some stuffs for the birthday event so we missed the sunset and had to decorate in rush too, so just get everything prepared before arriving there so that you don't rush with limited daylight left about couple of hours like we did after our check-in nearly at 4pm. Food for dinner is plenty at the jetty restaurants."
Nice place. Definitely a place to go and check it out.
Fantastic place!
"Many Singaporeans might be familiar with the idea of cruising onboard large vessels, but if you prefer a more private getaway, a yacht stay is for you. Onboard Jo & Lionel's yacht, you can expect an unforgettable experience for you and your friends. If you're planning a staycation, why not do it on a boat instead of a hotel?"
"Definitely recommend. Both Jo and Lionel were very promt, helpful and friendly. Cleanliness was top notch. Thank you for the wonderful experience."
"A very friendly and homely stay in the city. The little park just outside made the place feel peaceful and calm. The warmhearted and helpful hosts made my stay there feel a bit like a home away from home, so I can only give this place my best recommendations! "
"Awesome place to stay !! 100% recommend ! Easy to approach , food around ,near shopping centre, mrt abt 5 mins walk , I love the view from window , exactly the same as shown pic . Many many thanks for Catherine quick respond , very helpful . I'd love to stay when my next return !"
"Stylish, clean and neat space. Spacious and well maintained. Conveniently surrounded by local food, amenities. Lovely hosts as well. Highly recommended!"
Excellent accommodation  in a great location. We had a wonderful stay. Catherine recommended a great hawker centre and quick to respond to queries. The accommodation was larger than expected and a nice quiet area but close to plenty food places and transport. We'd recommend to anyone looking to stay in Singapore.
"ä½_½®__¸¸_¹ä¾¿,è·__mrtå¾__,_¿é_å¾_¹²_,______ä¹___"
"Catherine's place is just a 5 min walk to Farrer Park - so makes a great base for holidays or work. It's a lovely spacious room & Catherine was very prompt with all her replies - particularly when we had a hiccup.
Just note - the kitchen is open & doesn't have aircon so unless you want to brave cooking in the humidity it probably isn't a good idea! No microwave or oven, just stove top."
"The place is near to the mall, mrt and food joints.  It is very calm place to stay.  I highly recommend this place."

"Definitely recommend! The accomodation was clean and you__l have privacy as you get your own bathroom. Also location was convenient as it__ close to MRT station which is only few stops away from the middle of the city. 
Catherine was very nice and she responded to the message quickly whenever I needed help."
"Amazing place! Great location, very clean and charming, comfortable stay, and helpful host. Walkable to farrer park MRT station which has a large shopping mall in it so that__ a big plus for food and groceries."
"The place is nice and clean, also really close to the mrt station! Catherine was very easy to be contacted."
Good location! Close to many interesting places and only 8min to reach MRT station. The host is very nice and replied my messages quickly. Basic and clean equipment offered.
"Everything is good, except the sound barrier. But this is acceptable if your neighbors don't make big noises. Anyway, thanks for hosting and i will stay here if go to Singapore again."
"A lovely calm oasis just a short walk from Farrer Park MRT and Little India with hundreds of eateries and shops.
A lovely room with super fast WiFi which is really important for me for work and also to watch my Netflix at night with no issues.
Catherine is brilliant and really helpful.
You can__ go wrong really."
"I was only able to stay three nights but my experience was exceptional. The location is right next to an open grassy area/park and noise was at a minimum. Everything I needed was within walking distance although I like to wander so the walk to the MRT was less than ten minutes allowing me easy access to the entire city. 

The room is modern and as clean as can be. I have no complaints about the room and I will certainly return here if my travels bring me back to Singapore."
"A lovely quiet oasis in the madness of  Singapore. Very close to Farrer Park MRT station and Little India where there are hundreds of places to eat.
WiFi is excellent and able to watch my Netflix on the laptop without issue which is great.
Very quiet little corner location so no traffic which is perfect for me.
I will be back."
"Great place, highly recommended. 
The location is close to mrt station, and various businesses around.
Catherine responses were quick."
Super clean
"A stay here a lot as nice room, great bathroom, super fast wifi so I can watch my Netflix and close to MRT and tons of places to eat and drink."

"A lovely quiet oasis on the fringe of little India with a MRT station very close and a variety of restaurants and bars within a short walk.
Super fast WiFi which lets me watch my Netflix without issue."
"I have stayed here a few times now and it just constantly delivers a great stay without issue.
Really convenient for MRT and many bars and restaurants but just far enough away to provide a lovely quiet oasis after a hard days work. Wifi is super quick so I can watch my Netflix which is great."

Once again a faultless stay in a great place
"I just keep going back because of the super fast WiFi, the location and the peaceful surroundings yet close enough to walk to everything you could want and need"
__¸¸å¥½ç_ä½_é«__
"So clean & comfy, totally gonna come back again"
Nice place in the heart of Singapore! Easy contact and help! Would definitely stand here again!
"Clean and nice furnished room.
Good view from the window. 
There__ also Mustang King Duran stall within 500m walk. 
The only regret is that living Near the little Indian but I just went there once and didn__ try Indian food there___ï¸"
"Isaac and Catherine have a cool place in a great location near the subway system and a wonderful hawker center. They__e great communicators and very helpful with food recommendations, and Isaac even helped me with calling the airlines since my flights were affected by the corona virus spread. The AC works great and the place is clean. Just be aware of the morning wake-up crowing by the nearby roosters (just like in many parts of Asia; no alarm needed), but this is a great place to stay.  I__ stay here again."
"All was fine. The location is great and everything was easy. There's a shop and a cheap and good indian food corner in the rangoon road at 3 minutes of the house.
I would definitely recommend Catherine's place."
One of many weeks I__e spent here without issue.
Another good stay. One of many here.
As great a stay as ever
OK.
"Great location and communication from the host. Although do not that the bathroom is shared, and not attached to the room, I didn't know this before arriving at the unit and finding this out."
"Every detail about how to get to the apartment, including pictures were sent by Ong making it get there really easy to get there and check in. It is just by an MRT station, so the location is very convenient. We were also given tips on how to see the Chinese New Year fireworks. The room was spacious and comfortable. It was a good stay!"
_°æå¥
close to the MRT but a little hard to find. Comfortable room.
"Go for it, it's a great place! Perfect location in the middle of Chinatown, just 10 seconds away from the mrt, you can also walk to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. The place was very clean, and A LOT of shampoos, soaps, etc were available for us. Our room had a great view over the city. There is a nice atmosphere both in the apartment and in the neighborhood. The host also sent us many pictures to smooth our arrival, making it very easy to find and stress-free. Definitely recommend!"
Excellent location that impressed us both. Thanks!
Great value and hospitality
"Wonderful apartment! The manager, Elle is really patient and lind. I lost my key by accident and she came from Malysia to send me the key. I would highly recommend you to come to this apartment, which is a cozy place to love."
"Good Place, easy to find, clean and if you love chinese food, this place is very recomended."
"Recommend,will stay here again when next time visit to Singapore.

Just a quick word to sign these premises where I stayed was amazing very close to food court just take the lift downstairs amazing cleanest and Hospitality always want to help
"Ong__ place is in a good location in china town, but difficult to find initially. Very close to public transportation and places to eat. Clean space, and good value."
"Super Empfang, viele _berraschungen. Tolle Lage! Danke Ane"
"great location, friendly host, very close to MRT a home away from home :-)"
Ong's place in the heart of Chinatown makes Singapore accessible and many places easy to reach by taxi and public transport. The stay isn't lavish but is well worth it's value.
Really conveniently located in the central Chinatown area. Host was nice enough to let us store our luggage in the apartment before we left for the airport.
Great location! Extremely accommodating and friendly host!
"Location is right next to the MRT so it's easy to get around Singapore and is right outside of Chinatown Hawker centre. The room was very clean and had an amazing view.

Ong was very welcoming and helpful and tended to any issues I had immediately.

Would 100% rebook again."
"Le logement de Ong est idÃ©alement placÃ© pour s'immerger dans le "" vrai ""quartier chinois  de Singapour. A la fois, central pour prendre les transports qui vous mÃ¨neront aux diffÃ©rents sites touristiques et calme une fois qu'on y est !  Ong  Ã©tant absent sur la pÃ©riode oÃ¹ nous sommes venus, nous a  accompagnÃ© par messagerie et a fait en sorte que Elle  vienne  nous chercher au petit supermarket 7-Eleven  _ la sortie du mÃ©tro pour nous guider dans ce quartier grouillant et trÃ¨s vivant, surtout en soirÃ©e et de nuit. Une fois grimpÃ©s par ascenseur au 30 Ã¨me Ã©tage pour redescendre _ pieds au 27 Ã¨me ,  nous avons trouvÃ© une chambre parfaitement propre avec une vue incroyable ! La chambre climÃ©e, Ã©videment, est Ã©quipÃ©e de tout ce dont on a besoin. Nous recommandons vivement cette adresse pour son rapport qualitÃ© prix, la propretÃ©, sa situation et la gentillesse de Elle qu'il faut un peut apprivoiser dans un premier temps."
"Dear Ong and Elle, 
huge thank you for the amazing apartments and hospitality.

Thank you for helping us to find you, thanks for the cleaness and view, thanks for everything, it was really amazing experience_"
It is a very cozy and comfy place and also close to the station.  The host is very much warm and helpful. Chinatown station is close to everywhere. I would definitely stay there if I visit Singapore again.
"Big comfortable room in an ideal location. The location in Chinatown is perfectly central, and the metro is just outside the door, which makes it perfect for getting around to the different parts of the city. Also, there is an amazing hawker food court just below the building, which alone is a great reason to stay here. There are several rooms on Airbnb in the apartment, but I only saw a couple people and it was very quiet."
"Ong__ place is an apartment in a large block of flats across the road from Chinatown. The room is super-clean and so are the bathroom facilities, and there are nice touches, such as mini fridge and kettle in the room, as well as super-fast WiFi. Ong was very responsive and gave me precise instructions on how to get to his place. Great place to stay, with MRT access right nearby."
the location is very nice.
"What I like about this place is the accessibility to the transit. Also, lots of restaurants around because you're in Chinatown. If you're a tourist, there are a lot of money changers below the residential building. My room's size was just right for me, nice views, and the smart tv was fantastic. Very clean and well maintained shower rooms and toilets."
Good location and great facilities
"Me and my sister stayed at Laetitia's place for 5 nights and we had a good stay..
The apartment is around 10 minutes walk from MRT (exit B) and bus stop.. The place itself located in residential area so it's quite and peaceful..
Our room is bigger so we can unpacked and packed our luggage easily.. Bed and pillows are soft and cozy so we had a good sleep everyday.. Other rooms (bathroom, kitchen, and living room) are have many amenities.
Laetitia is kind and friendly.. She waited us for more than an hour because we got lost on our way to her place and welcomed us warmly :)"
"Heritage apartment building with good floor plan and size with some French touch decoration. Comfortable bed and all facilities are in good condition and convenient to use.  Nice breeze and quiet at night.  The host is welcoming and friendly.  She introduced some useful local APPs to us, those were very helpful when we get around.  We enjoyed our stay very much."
Very kind and friendly host. Home was very comfortable and spacious and nicely decorated. AC and fan worked great. Only 5-7 minute walk from the train. Overall had a great experience and would stay here again!
I stayed at Laetitia's place before relocating my permanent flat. The place is spacious and well linked to everywhere. I enjoyed my stay a lot not only because the flat is very nice but also she is a great host. I am as comfortable as I am at home. Recommend to everyone!!
"I enjoyed staying at Laetitia's apartment so much!
It's spacious, airy, functional, beautiful!
Every area in the flat is great on its own.
It's not just a space for rent. It's very real and you feel indeed like-a-local.
I'm very grateful for this chance to stay there.
One comment for the future guests: the house numbering system in Singapore maybe a bit unconventional for you. Make sure that you get all the arrival details from the host in advance."
"Laetitia is a super kind host and her place is great! Spacious & clean, with all amenities needed. The apartment is located just between two main subway lines and was easy to find. 10/10 would crash again."
"A very very charming and beautiful appartment, ""old"" with SG reference, which in my mind is very positive..."
"A great place you should experience when visiting Singapore. Nice decoration and amenities prepared will make you feel comfortable. Besides, the house near MRT and center of the country so you can enjoy your trip easily :D Recommend to everyone!!"
Lovely place :) I slept like a log each night.
"The old and spacious apartment is about 15mins walk from the NewtonMRT. Singapore is very hot and humid. I stayed for about 10 nites, after 2 days, I resort to taking a bus which cut short about  6mins of walk, and crossing the Overhead Bridge  from the MRT. Apartment is lovely, as the photo and the room is large. Spring bed is soft,  if you like bouncy spring bed.  Quiet, and nice green, landed properties surrounding the apartment. I did some laundry and hung the clothes in the laundry area, which will generally dry the following day.  For bathroom and toilet, its shared with the host. There is one in the apartment only.. It is a spacious shower room, and water is hot too. Shampoo etc are provided. Wifi is also very good in the apartment as well. Netflix is available. The Aircon in the bedroom is very old type and noisy so I do not turn it on, but there is a ceiling fan, that works fine for me."
"A quite place but if you enjoy walking, you can consider this place as the nearest MRT station, Newton is  approx. 600m away. Laetitia is a nice host & her place is quiet & you will have your privacy."
The apartment is located in a nice quiet neighborhood. Although the building is quite old the room is kept nice and clean. Air conditioner is old but I slept fine with the ceiling fan on. Bathroom is shared with the host. Laetitia is super nice and easy going. She let me put my stuff down although I arrived early in the morning. Also it was easy to communicate with her through messages as she responded fast. I highly recommend this place to stay in Singapore.
The location is amazing and the house is very open and airy. Loved it
"Perfect Location, close to a MRT station, room was big enough, detailed recommendations"
"It__ super awesome ! I would like to give it ten starts . Close to MRT station . A good food centre close to it . The environment is so nice , clean and quiet ! Leatitia  is so friendly and Kind . It__ really like a home here . You will feel so comfortable to stay here ."
Here you will encounter a super friendly host with her cozy apartment close to tasty and convenient food hawker centre.
"Very nice and clean apartment, perfectly situated to explore Singapore!"
"I was in Singapore for a conference over the weekend and it was a very short trip.  Before coming over to Singapore, Laetitia has well informed me about how to reach to her place.  She responded very quickly and very friendly.  Her place is very clean, very home-y and very comfortable. I slept like a baby at night.  There is enough space for me to put my stuff and the amenities are just as described in the description.   Although the air conditioner is noisy (I personally found it is acceptable), having the fan on in summer time is still fine.  The area is near MRT and I can still reach back late at night safely.  Thank you Laetitia for her great hospitality!!"
"Lovely apt, spacious and super easy going. Perfect for people spending the week and looking for a quiet place to do some work."

"It was a very stylish apartment and Laetitia is a fantastic host, very welcoming, helpful. If we would go to Singapore, no question we would like to stay with her again"
Laetitia__ place was warm and welcoming. I felt safe and comfortable. Laetitia is a warm and generous soul. I recommend her place without any hesitations.
"This place is nice, and I enjoyed my stay.  About a 10 minute walk to Newton MRT.  Host was very accommodating to my schedule.  Only nit is the mattress is soft and I greatly prefer a firmer mattress."
Laetitia is a nice host. The place is cute and itself has a warm heart. They will help you feeling like home.
"Laetitia__ place is amazing, nice decoration, comfy bed and couch, perfect for solo travelers. Location is quite convenient, close to the town, and a few mins walk to MRT. LaÃ«titia is super nice, prepared all different travel tips, responds fast, I will recommend her place to all travelers"
Really good place and Laetitia is very kind person. So happy have this experience to stay this nice place. Thank you for these four days.
"I and my wife love this apartment. It's cozy and clean apartment. I feel like we were living our home. There are everything: relaxing bedroom, large living room, kitchen,  private bathroom and washing machine."
"5/5 would recommend again. Laetitia was a wonderful host, with easy and efficient communication :)"
"Located nearby the commercials area, you can easily find supermarket and convenience stores below. This place is also easy to reach by buses/taxis."
Good place to crash in a nice residential area. Found myself some nice chicken rice in the area too which was a bonus.  The flat itself was clean and Tara was  very professional.
There is a cool running track just down the apartment !
"Tara's place is really amazing, it is amazingly clean and very centralized location. And the check in is very easy. If I have another visit to Singapore, I am willing to stay at her place again."
"A fairly new space that is clean and stylish. The facilities are complete. IZ and Catherine were really great hosts and helpful throughout the stay.

Catherine is a great host! I arrived at her place at midnight and she stayed up late to ensure I could get into my room. The room was clean and stylish. The nearest MRT station is just 5-6 mins away by foot.
Very nice place and easy to get around.
"Thanks so much to Catherine__ hospitality during my stay at her place. Very clean room and well equipped, the bathroom was magnificent.
Very strategic location, 5 mins. walk to the North East Line MRT, and 2 mins away from the nearest bus station, lots of good food surround the area also. 
The mustafa market which is open for 24 hours, is located within a walking distance, very convenient 
Overall *****"
"Catherine's AirBnB is a hidden gem. It is very clean, nicely decorated and it features all the amenities one could wish for. Catherine herself is a very friendly hostess. She made sure I felt welcome. I will definitely stay at her place again!"
"This place is simply perfect. You get a lot of space for Singapore at a great price. The building is quiet, easy to access and has a nice Garden at the top where you can sit outside and listen to the city.  I traveled alone and this place felt like my home for 8 days.  Easy to access the buses and MRT. Lots of shops and places to eat around the corner, but you still get a quiet residential feeling. You get a lot of privacy in the building, no one is in your face but there is always help if you need it.
Easy to wash, dry and iron your laundry here as well. 
Highly recommend this over the hotels in the area. Thank you Catherine!"
"A nice space in a quiet cul de sac. The room is large with a good workspace, super cold aircon and super quick internet so all good.
The helper who lives in is great and super helpful and the kitchen is well stocked.
Complimentary shampoo, conditioner and shower gel is a nice touch. MRT is just 2 minutes away and right on the fringe of Little India with hundreds of places to eat."
Amazing place with balcony area! Highly recommended!!
"Almost 5 min walk from MRT NE8 Farrer Park Station, also very near NE7 Little India Station. Has big washroom, living room and portable water supply system. Everywhere is clean and nice. Host response very quick (usually within 1 min), very enjoy my trip here."
Wonderful place to stay at.
Posto molto pulito anche grazie ad una persona delle pulizie quasi sempre presente. Cucina e frigo in comune ben tenuti. Stanza ben descritta dalle foto. Tranquillo e silenzioso
"Very seamless checkin process, clean, and it's a good amount space considering the price!

Would definitely stay here again."
"Catherine's place is at a perfect location, straightforward to get around with public transportation and walking distance to awesome restaurants. Her home is excellent, spotless and has everything you need.__The host was also accommodating since the beginning. I traveled alone for a business trip and felt like my home for 15+ days. I highly recommend it.  Thank you Catherine!"

Catherine was quick to respond and always made sure we were looked after. Room was nice and clean and bathroom is quite spacious.
"Catherine's place is simply perfect. It's clean with big bathroom and convenient interior. There is a nice garden on top where you can read a book or just take breath in the pure morning. 
The bed is too small for 2 adults, I think it's only fit for 1 as it's size is only 1.3mx2m.

Thank you Catherine for your hospitality :)
The place is excellent with all the amenities. The MRT station helps you move around everywhere very easily. A great place to stay.
Excellent location - Excellent place - Great Amenities - Best for work!
Another stay in this lovely quiet place with super fast WiFi and great location that is lovely and quiet
Stayed here many times and always good
"Tidy, cozy and pricing is well worth it. Perfect for tourists who like to go around using public transportation."
"Lovely, clean and tidy. Situated within walking distance of Farrier MRT which was awesome. Nice cosy place, and again just so clean. Highly recommend it to travelers"
"Mostly good things about this place as others have mentioned.
2 improvements
Suggest better bed keeping.
Curtains for the windows."
_____________¾ã__!
A nice super clean place in a quiet cul de sac very close to Little India and a short walk to Farrer Park MRT. I stop here a lot on business because of its location and super fast wifi.
"The experience in Rajan__ house had NOT A THING GOOD except the fact that they had a nice facility. When I first got the actual contract, I was so surprised to see that the location of the house is totally different from what it said in the website. It said it was 8min walk from Botanic garden but it actually took 1hr walk. Even if when he realized that he made a mistake about the location pt, he just told me that there is no way that he can refund the money back to me, so just take 300 Singapore dollars (somehow he estimated himself as a the transportation fee) back and live in the house. I was so angry about  his attitude, however, I just gave up and decided to travel more because I was just a student came Singapore to study, so I 
did not want to make more deal with it.

Unfortunately, the trouble in this airbnb did not stopped there. When I was half way through the lease (I had a month lease) , the home owner literally just called me with his mad voice saying that I need to LEAVE the house by the next morning because the host did not paid him and is not answering his call. I thought I was caught in some kind of fraud and called Rajan but he only said that he can deal with it just do not worry about it. However for that entire day I had to be tortured by the homeowner asking for the update. I even had to get out in the middle of the class to pick up the phone, not to be kicked out of this house. At that night Rajan texted me that whether I can pay the homeowner another 3k instead of him. That moment, I just wanted to say that let me kicked out of this house and get the rest of the money back. I just do not understand the fact that why did he asked  me to take the responsibility for the job that host gets paid for. At last he dealt with the problem, but I am writing about this to let ppl who are looking into leasing this house."
Catherine is a great host. The room is a  nice cozy attic to stay in with a nice open rooftop area to chill out at.

"We were lucky to find this place. The room is better than i expected, the aircon works well, bathroom and kitchen is clean, the host was very kind and helpfull.  Just walk 5 minutes and you will find the nearest MRT (farrer park MRT). We stay for 3 nights, and everyday we had breakfast at pek kio hawker near the airbnb (just 5 min walk). We enjoy our stay, this place is recommended. Thank you"
Very comfortable bed. Great air conditioning. Brilliant Location. Quiet yet minutes from MRT station which made it so easy to get to tourist attractions
We had a great time! Spacious  place and the terrace is a great bonus and really has very nice views.  If I come back I will stay again

"Catherine & her husband always does extra miles beyond hosts during our stay with them. It almost seems that we do not need to worry about anything, they will do their best to see to our needs. 

Apart from the exceptional hospitality, we were living in the room we truly fell in love with. At night, we could see watch the stars while having our dinner in the balcony. Not to mention, it__ a steal for such a huge balcony for this price! 

We truly enjoyed our stay, amenities, transportation, serenity and peaceful night. what can one as for? 

Lastly, we would like to thank our powerful couple hosts who took care of us and invited us to this magnetic gem of a place! stay safe and take care both!"

Place was clean and very comfortable. Recommend to anyone on a work trip with colleagues or a family holiday stay.
"Very modern, clean and upscale. Perfect place if you are looking for 3 bedroom and 3 bathrooms which is rare."
"My family and I had a great stay at Rj__. The apartment was clean, well located and fit the five of us comfortably!"
Great space better then advertised very easy to use as a home base in Singapore and take taxis around town.
"Very good apartment. We have eight adults and three children in two two-bedroom apartments this time. The room is clean and tidy, and the kitchen and bathroom are good for use. It's a little far from the subway station, but it's very convenient for us all to take taxis in Singapore, which is more cost-effective. Breakfast is slightly monotonous, but plentiful. The swimming pool is great."
nice place just as shown in pics. in a quiet neighbourhood. and well connected .
Nice apartment
"Staying at James_ place is just great. From the warm and personal welcome to a very clean and wonderful little apartment everything is perfect. Everything was provided and replies came quick and hassle-free. The location is awesome. Highly recommended-would definitely stay here again. 
Thank you!"
"James and Janet have a pair of listings (loft and suite). They both showed up to do the check-in that included a walk through of the building amenities.

 I stayed in the loft space. The space was fine for a no-frills solo business traveler but it would probably be a bit on the small side for a couple. It's very close to the golden mile food complex, arab street, and only a short walk from the circle line. Commuting downtown is easy enough but requires a transfer between circle and downtown lines. When I stayed the occupancy inside the city gate mall was a bit lacking but over time it should improve. City gate does have a very nice pool and gym.

The shower was just ok. It was spacious and modern but the shower pressure was lacking. functionally it was fine. 5/10

The bed was comfortable enough -- a bit on the softer side. I didn't mind the loft but some people might find it too be a bit of a chore.

The kitchen/dining area make very efficient use of the limited space. There is 2 burner electric hob with a sauce pan and frying pan. It's ok for cooking noodles/pasta but that's probably about it. The fridge is big enough for 6 eggs, cheese, butter, yogurt and 4 beers. The small dining table is not really practical but the arm chairs with the side table are a good substitute.

Overall, the loft was definitely better than a hotel. Even though the space is somewhat limited it was very functional. I was able to store a small amount of food, cook breakfast/snacks, and do laundry -- all things I find challenging in a hotel. The close proximity to transportation, restaurants, and shops makes the location on par with a hotel at a very competitive rate.

I don't think I would stay in the loft again but I would absolutely stay with Janet & James in the full sized unit (suite)."
"I stayed here on a business trip, the apartment fit my purpose perfectly.  It isn't overly spacious but for the limited time that I was there it was clean and comfortable and had all the amenities I could have needed.  The location is great, there are lots of places to get excellent food and drink nearby and the transport links to the city are very easy.  The hosts were great - very friendly when meeting me for checkin and did not disturb throughout my stay."
Great location. Minutes to Bugis and local food around the area.
Great location. Great host.
The host canceled this reservation 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
Unterkunft ist in einer wohlhabenen Einfamiliensiedlung. Markt ist nahbei. MRT (Metro) Anbindung ist gut zu erreichen.  Die Unterkunft ist sauber und ordentlich. WI-FI vorhanden. Fernseher auch. Die Familie mit Kindern lebt auch in dem Haus. es ist aber alles in allem ruhig. Ich komme gerne wieder.
"This is a big room in a suer large house, can't belive in singarpore you can find a big room in such resonalble price, the house cleaned spotless,  the kid doesn't make any noise. I got a great stay with the family. If you don't require a good location, then this is the best choice. 5 stars recommend."
"Great place, conveniently located and Ailing's helper was kind enough to wait up for me given my late night arrival."
Ailing was extremely accommodating of my crazy flight schedule. Air conditioning worked great. Very much enjoyed my stay!
Highly recommended place!
"This is a fantastic choice if you are transiting through Singapore for work for 1 or 2 days. It is very convenient for Changi Airport and not too far from the metro station, walkable in 10 mins or so. the house is very clean, I didn't meet the host but the maid was helpful and check-in check-out were smooth. The house is very clean, the wifi could be a little unstable but overall did the job. I recommend this place highly."
"It was all good except for the fact that the surroundings were too dark at night. The room was clean, neat and nice."
"Ailing's place is a great place to stay, close to the airport and well accessible from the city. Ailing and Peter were amazing hosts and the entire process was smooth and easy. Highly recommended :)"
sweet place nice host
"Ailing and Peter  is incredible. There are very accommodating and very quick to respond with any questions. There are also flexible with check-in and check-out time, which was extremely helpful. The place was very clean and had all of the necessities for a few night stay."
I think the place was very well worth for value
"The place is 2 bus stops away from the nearest MRT station. Ailing is a nice host and her daughter is truly adorable. The maid has been really helpful , too. All the windows in the house are usually shut, but the good a/c unit makes up for the lack of natural air flow. Honestly, the pillow was too flat for a comfortable sleep. For some reasons, the desk in the picture was removed. There is a big TV in the room, but you can't really watch anything on it. All in all, it is ok for a brief stay or transit."
Ailing is a very warm and thoughtful person. The location is convenient and easy to find. I would recommend this place particularly for solo traveller.
"Clean and safe.cute baby.vvvvv nice.
A word~perfect"
Perfect host! Highly recommend!!
Such a great hospitality! Love the stay! Will definitely come back again!
"Very convenient for the airport, buses are <100m away"
Superb communication from Kaurus
"Pretty much like the pictures so no surprises, nothing fancy, you get what you pay for. Good location, near a lot of food spots (including a 24 restaurant just downstairs), bus just a few feet away and 2 MRT stations closeby.

A thing to note: the walls are pretty thin  can hear your neighbor snoring or on the phone and/or people using the bathroom. So if you're a light sleeper might wanna consider a pair of earplugs."
"A very clean and cosy place for single travellers, 10/10 recommend!"
"-Nice and friendly Host
-23hrs Restaurant just below.
-Walking distance to Lavender Mrt"
near MRT fort canning
"Great location, easy check in, and really responsive host. Really convenient for a short stay."
"Nothing much, accommodation is great."
"Great location, walking distance to Robinson Square and the river.
Aaron responded to communications quickly and helpfully."
Aaron is a very responsive and friendly host. He has a team of nice colleagues helping him out as well. He tries to accommodate requests promptly to the best of his abilities. Overall he is an outstanding host who tries his best to help his tenants have a comfortable stay.
"Fantastic apartment! Spacious, very clean and amazing location right in the heat of Orchard Road. Zoelyn attended to our every need promptly. The apartment had everything we needed, great for families or couples. Will definitely book again."
"Amazing Place to stay. Located just inside the mall you have dozens of cheap options to eat. The flat is big and has all amenities needed. The guy helping us on-site (as usual Thats not the host) was an amazing help for everything we asked for.
Nice view too.

Only little minus were the ants in the kitchen, however every flat in Sgp has this Problem and they brought us poison for them immediately"
"Good location ,convenient to go many places, tip top cleanliness, receptionist very responsive and friendly, place is well maintained and cozy. Family friendly because i bring baby with me. will go again if i go singapore."
This apartment was a great two bedroom place. It was sparkling clean and had all the basic necessities. Beds were super comfy and the location was quite central. Would definitely stay again!
"I loved Zoelyn__ place. The location could not be better. The place was very spacious and clean, and it has incredible view. I highly highly recommend staying here. 100% would stay here again if I were to be in Singapore in the future."
"I highly recommend this listing. Location was great. Near the train station, shopping malls, restaurants, convenience stores, hospital, etc. Easy access for taxi pick up and drop off. Very accurate with the showed pictures. The view was great as well since it is situated in a high floor. The apartment is clean and very big so I recommend this to travellers of big groups. Very smooth check-in and check-out as well. The host replies quickly too. She provided necessary stuff as well. The internet connection was great too if you just wanna stay in the apartment to chill no problem! Over all experience 5-star  thanks!"
"Zoelyn's place is very clean, she is a nice and friendly host. The location is also very strategic, in the city center, and very close to the mall and MRT. Her place is also suitable for families who bring children."
Large apartment with a nice view in the heart of Orchard street. Check-in and communication with the host was easy. Wifi & washer/dryer worked well.
"Strategic location, clean, spotless and spacious house. Great for group and family."
"A great big place and very comfortable staying. Really enjoy the place, friendly host and quick responses from them. Very clean and all items are provided so we don't need to prepare anything."

This apartment was spacious, beautiful, tidy and clean.
We had a very smooth check-in and the response through Airbnb between seconds.
They even put the touch for small kids.
They got a wooden horse toy for toddler and had a baby chair!!!!
Thank you so much, and definitely will stay here again next time!"
"The place is exactly the same (or even better than) as the photo included, the entire place is sparkling clean, host is very responsive, best experience so far"
"The view from this place is awesome and worth paying for, also u have mall attached to the apartment so u can buy souvenirs and gifts for your friends and family real quick. The host allowed us for an early check-in which was really sweet of her and the place is in the center of the main market so u can find many shopping areas nearby. Great place for Family/friends."
Great place and location.   Very responsive hosts!
"Zoe and friends are such a great host. They pay attention to little details in the apartment to what a family needs.

We really enjoyed staying at the apartment, they provide  high chair for kids, utensils and even little red deer chair to play with. But most of all what__ amazing about this place  , it has Netflix as entertainment! It__ useful to help babysit my son for 30 mins or so. :) 

I also like how you prepare some plates , cups and utensils for children. 

We really love your place, it__ very conveniently located in the center of everything. Malls just a minute walk, subway and busses just right in front of the apartment. We also like the trash parachute is inside the apartment, very efficient to clean up. 

Our suggestion only the bath towels can be better , the one you provide  are not as absorbent as cotton materials. It will be great if there__ salt and pepper in the kitchen for simple cooking. (eggs for breakfast) 

We would love to stay in your place again in the future. 

We also would like to thank you for helping us to get our USB back. We really appreciate your prompt reply and willingness to help."
"Like other people said, it is a very clean, strategic place in Ochard. Easy to communicate with the host, the host is very quick in response. It has a very complete house appliances, you can wash your clothes and use the dryer machine to dry your clothes and wear immediately. Perfect for family"
It is just a short walking distance to MRT. Modern and spacious interior.
Thanks for the good apartment
"Zoe's apartment is located in a prime location, it is so covenient for people who come to Singapore for check up at Mount Elizabeth hospital and holiday. The place is also clean despite of the building exterior. Zoe's is also thoughtful to allow us for allowing us to do early check in and providing us with baby crib. Thanks Zoe!"

Washing machine and driers were provided making the stay a whole lot more pleasant. A recommended place to stay if you have a lot of people on board (5+) at the heart of Singapore's shopping district. Great host and very prompt with their replies. 10/10"
"My family and I had a wonderful time staying at this apartment. The place is clean, spacious, has everything that we need in a great location. We were allowed to store luggage until 2 pm which was a great help. Will definitely come back. Thank you Zoe and friends for the hospitality."
"The host is extremely helpful and response quickly.
The check in was easy as she carefully explain to me how to get into the apartment. it was very easy. 
The living room was big but one of the 2 bathrooms were extremely small. 
overall the apartment was comfortable.
When we had problems with the lock, the host immediately contacted lock smith to come and change the next day. super helpful and nice.

The place is very nice and spacious and very accessible to anything to want in Singapore.
Comfortable and clean
"Clean and very nice unit, located at the center of orchard road. Great value indeed."
"We had an amazing stay in this apartment (3 adults and 1 child) - the location is superb for roaming around Orchard. The check in and - out was super easy, Zoe & Friends were very responsive and had made sure that everything we needed was there; from shampoo to travel adapters to wine opener.
We highly recommend booking this place if you're a traveling family or just like to stay in some homely surroundings. We will definitely try to stay here again!"
"We were eight in the group so I was really looking for a big place and central area where everything is accessible. And Zoe__ place is the perfect one. They have extra beds and it can actually accommodate more than 8. The receiving area and the dining area is what we enjoyed the most. Check in was so convenient and well given instructions. The only thing that I can comment was the water heater in the main bathroom wasnt functioning and it was just during our last day that we were able to use the water heater. I just didnt bother asking Zoe about it since the water is not too cold anyways. But nevertheless, we had a good stay. I can recommend this for big groups/family."
"Zoe's place on Lucky Plaza is highly recommended for a big family vacation, have a perfect tourist location, near to MRT station and ION mall."
"Simply perfect: 

1. Great location (along Orchard, just about 100m from MRT, and there are convenience stores, shops, and restaurants in the same building)

2. Sparkling clean 

3. Comforable beds (there are three beds, each of which can comfortably fit 2 adults and a small kid. There are also extra mattresses)

4. Allows very easy trash disposal 

5. Has amenities for cooking 

6. Has properly working airconditioning 

7. Has good-speed wifi and smart tv 

8. Spacious

9. Very nice kitchen, sala, and bedroom.

"I really enjoyed my stay here, will definitely come back!"
"Location is great, just some needs to update inside the unit.."
Very clean and nice place. Location is very strategic!!
"The apartment is located at Lucky Plaza, at the heart of Orchard, surrounded by Takashimaya, Ion, Paragon and Mount Elizabeth hospital, just to name a few. So many restaurants and gift shops downstairs, and near the Orchard MRT. The unit is sparkling clean and all the basic amenities are provided. Zoe is a great host and quick in response. Highly recommended for a big family (the unit can fit up to 8 adults). My family and I had a wonderful time staying at this apartment :)"
The place is highly recommended for family with kids. It is spacious and the host is thoughtful. You can find all you need well-prepared in the unit. It has good view due to high floor. The unit is windy with good air circulation in the evening. You can enjoy fresh breeze when you open the windows. The unit is accessible and convenient.
very nice and cheap place to stay.

I enjoy staying at Apple__ place. Her husband and she were so willing to offer help and their efficiency is highly appreciated. There is an adorable and quiet dog at their place and I bet people who love dogs would love to stay here. The swimming pool is the most unexpected part due to its huge size. I enjoyed swimming there a lot and it is really a fancy place to stay.
"Apple is a very nice lady, very friendly to her guests."
"Apple is very friendly, will come back again :)"
Great place!!
Best choice of option!!
Very nice and friendly
"Apple is friendly and kind.
Available for only condo shuttle bus, very convenient."
"Apple and her husband are both very nice. Apple picked me up when I arrived, and her husband helped me wash clothes. Most importantly, they can kindly take my advice and improve themselves. The room is super clean and cozy. I highly recommend her place."
"Nice place but due to Circuit Breaker in Singapore, did not use the condo facilities. But place is near supermarket & food outlets which is convenient."
Fantastic location as very close to food precincts covering all budgets. Would definitely stay there again!
Aaron__ Place is very recommend for family trip or Group trip. The location is near to the city and also MRT. Great Place to stay. Will come back soon to his Place :)
"Had a wonderful time at Aaron__ place. Easy to access as it is located on the main road. The location was also great, near to several favorite local destinations."
"_´ä__½å_ä¸__,ç¦»å____ä¹__è¿_½¡"
Place was a mess from the previous tenants that just happened to move out on the same day as our check in. Aaron allowed me to cancel my booking and refund all of the cost without much hassle.
"Highly recoomended the host and place.she is so accomodating and you will feel you are at your home away from home.she so generous as well, everything she has, she will  offer."
"It's our second time.generous,considerate and thoughful host.highly recommended.the hawker next to her block all food are nice and tasty."
"Siri Noordin is a warm heart and experienced host and her apartment is a comfortable and convenient one. Also, the location is not far from the metro station. It is really worthy to be recommended to Airbnb guests."

Location is good for us. 15 mins walk to Yew Tee MRT station and eateries just downstairs. Host stays there but guest gets absolute privacy. Door bell doesn't work and needs to be fixed.
"Couldn__ have been better. The apartment was beautiful and equipped with everything I needed , especially when traveling with kids. The place is great, very clean and has everything you need. Kak Nor was also very helpful since the beginning, available at all times whenever I had any questions. Totally recommend it and surely will come again!"
We had a wonderful stay at Noor's unit. Noor is a very kind and hospitable host and we had no issues staying at her unit.
"The host is very friendly, punctually met us and promptly responded to  all my messages.   The place is clean and well-equipped with the essential amenities during our stay. 
 Much appreciate your hospitality and enjoyable accommodation ."

"Walter is a very warmhearted and careful person. His home is very clean ,cozy and comfortable.All of our four people have a perfect and satisfactory living experience,especially for the beautiful balcony. Such is a pity that we had no time to go swimming in the free swimming pool.Before the trip, Walter Had told us the abundant household items he provided and some detailed information to guide us to the home. He even picked us up at the MRT station and showed us around patiently in Chinese. He also offered us some snacks which made us moved. In general, living in Walter's house added color to my wonderful trip in Singapore. We really appreciate Walter's cordial hospitality a lot!Th (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) !"
Walter was very kind. His room was comfortable and very close to the station.
"Excellent host! Always answered the question so soon and provided so many useful information! The Location is good, very convenience with MRT. Strongly recommend to have accommodation here."
"The place was beyond my expectations, clean and beautiful. Very close to MRT and safe environment. Awesome host who communicated well and responded quickly. Would highly recommend!"
"Our stay at Walters place was amazing. The condo had a kitchen, a dining table and a balcony which were shared between the three rooms, we had our own bathroom with lots of toiletries. The pools were amazing and were open from early in the morning until around 10. The gym was good but small. The condo is a 5 minute walk to the MRT. 

Walter was a lovely host, he had good recommendations for places to eat and shop. He replied fast and could answer any questions we had. We would definitely return. Thanks Walter!"
I recommend. Very professional host. Quick responses. Good experience overall
"Wonderful stay and the host gives prompt respond, great location, and super nice place to stay, stable wifi and hot water."

We stayed for a weekend and the apartment was both clean and comfortable.  The stores on the bottom floor fulfilled any needs that we had. Mabel provided a complimentary transfer from the airport to the apartment which was very much appreciated as our flight landed at 11:00pm.  I would highly recommend staying here.

"This is an excellent place to stay. You can trust the photos and the description. IZ and Catherine were extremely responsive and easy to talk to, and the helper is great too."
"The house is very nice and clean, as accurately shown through photos. Unfortunately there has been some mix-ups and our room wasn__ cleaned in time of our check-in. However it was dealt with swiftly and neatly, not much inconvenience for us. Catherine and her husband IZ is very kind and hospitable, as well as their helper.
I found the location is a bit further from the MRT station than expected, maybe around 10 mins, maybe we forget to the Singapore heat that made the walk"

"I really recommend Catherine's place for whoever looking for a place in Singapore. Catherine's is a really professional and her hospitality is beyond my expectation. The place is clean, looks the same with the picture (even bigger than I thought) and a few decors make the place really cozy. There's a huge TV in my room and it hasn't shown in the room description when I booked the place. What I love about this place is the room doesn't use keys, so you don't have to carry heavy keys around and blame yourself when you got locked outside because you forgot your keys. Her response is very quick, one time I asked if there is a detergent and an hour later her helper came with detergent. It's a very nice gesture, this place has better hospitality and a cheaper price than most hotels."
"well equipped,friendly lord"
"A very nice place in Singapore, quiet and good located.

Thank you Catherine !"
"Catherine and her helpers were quite responsive. The place is modern, well-furnished (with a really big flat TV) and sparkling clean. Plus there__  a really nice rooftop/ balcony with view where you can enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning or stargazing in night. Highly recommended!  

There were only two tiny things troubled me: 1) Our room is on a second floor walk-up. That was definitely not easy for us whom carried two 30kg suitcases. Wish this could add in the description. 2) The bed was too soft for me but my travel bud felt ok."
"Amazing flat, nice location and good communication"
"We had a great stay in Catherine's apartment. It was perfectly equipped for three nights and the location in Little India and near the MRT was great. You can even reach the city center by feet (a little longer walk). The flat was clean and the communication with Catherine very good. There was only one tiny negative point: the mattress was way too soft for us, but we talked to Catherine about that and the other side of the mattress is harder ;) I can highly recommend this place!"
"Me and my friend think that the room is nice and cool (temperature-wise). :) We had issues with our toilet and also had only one blanket for the first night, but the host was easy to communicate with and responded to the problems fast."
Nice big room with comfy bed and Catherine is so helpful. Close to MRT station and loads of places to eat and drink just a short walk away
"Had a pleasant experience at Catherine's place. Good proximity to Little India. The room overlooks a nice expanse of greenery. The hosts' responses were super fast. If I were to nitpick, I found the mattress to be a little on the softer side."
If you can find an alternative to this place do choose that
Hat alles perfekt geklappt und wir waren zufrieden. Die Lage war auch gut. Sind immer in die Farrer Park MRT eingestiegen. Waren ungefÃ¤hr 10 Minuten zu laufen
"Good place to stay. 
Nice host and given all support.
Location is center so easy to travel around.
More cooking facilities and Toaster make attractive.

Highly recommended..!"
I really enjoyed my stay.
"Delightful , elegant and modern space with quaint surroundings. 

The host is very quick in their responses. 

The check-in is absolutely hassle free. 

Loved the terrace space overlooking trees , great place to have some coffee or beer."

Catherine is a superhost for a reason, she provided us with all the amenities, from A to Z. 
Check in and check out was a breeze, and the stay was even better. I also had some issue regarding the forex of my country and Catherine was happy to help. 
Choose this place without any second thought! 
Close proximity to the Farrer Park MRT, made my Singapore exploration easy. A big thumbs up to this property and the host!"

"The place is only 3 minutes walk to Farrer Park MRT, 10 minutes to Mustafa Center. You just can get to anywhere with MRT. The room is exactly the same as advertised, clean, modern and stylish and with complete amenities.  Checkin is definitely hassle free, just follow and read carefully what Catherine has just inform for the instructions. Catherine is great, helpful and very responsif host. It's highly recommend when you visit Singapore.

Don't think, just book and immediate confirm. You won't regret at all. Definitely come back again soon!"
"A beautiful place, very comfortable and near to public transport station. Catherine is a wonderful host. Would come back anytime."
"Catherine's place was fabulous. Smooth check-in proccess, easy access to MRT station, cleanness, and amenities...etc 
I would like to recommend her place to other travelers and come back again!"
"It__ a good place to stay, the host is so kind n the house is very clean ."
Stayed many times as it__ well located and super fast internet
"You'll get your own room and bathroom with a shared kitchen area. The hosts are very kind and communicative, and the helper Lyn is fantastic. Also, the location is great - a quick walk to coffee shops, restaurants, Farrer Park metro and City Square Mall."
"Bob's place is good value for money, it is a serviced apartment with detergent, towels and shampoo provided."
Everything was great here! The apartment was clean and the perfect size for 1-2 people. Bobs responses were quick and helpful. Would stay again!
"This apartment is too clean and customer service is very good as well. I spent 1 week here , they did do cleaning two times and refilled everything for us. Location is very good, it is too easy to catch bus to vivo city or bugis, Chinatown.... It is so great , out of our expectations. Thank you."
Great location.  Great responses. Only issue was wiring issue with lights.  Even turned off they were some how getting power and would flash on and off.    Great response to issue.  They upgraded me to the top floor suite/penthouse when couldn't resolve.
"Great place, very convenient and clean"
It was my first time using Airbnb. I was worried because of the check-in process. I sent Bob few questions and received his answers very detailed and soon. I__ very satisfied with the staffs at the building. The cleanliness and preparation are great as well.
Great place to stay. The place is the same as the photos. Great value for money. The MRT station is close enough so you are within reach of any place you can think of. The host's hospitality is really great.
"Had a great stay here. Very clean and modern. Also close to the bus stop which made it very easy to travel around and get to work (in the city). There aren't a lot of food options within walking distance, however Katong Village was a very short bus ride away and had plenty of great options."
Had an excellent experience during the stay!
Good location. Apartment has what is needed for a less than a month stay. Good kitchen. Pool area and gym nice. No problems with check in or check out - everything worked smoothly.
"_ great place to stay for short or long term 
Very clean and confortable 
Perfect communication 
All you would need for sure 
Thanks bob"
"Excellent accommodation in a spacious apartment. Everything was working fine and the cleaning was done well. Good location, with a 20 minute bus connection to CBD."
"Highly recommended, with my changing requirements over 6 weeks, I feel I made a good choice."
"Great and responsive host! 

Place is a charm, very near amenities, food Centre is just 10mins walk away. CBD is 10mins away. You can take a nice stroll or run by the beach or do a mini marathon along Gardens By The Bay. Love it!"
"I stayed here between apartments and found it a really clean, comfortable option. The room was a decent size and it was good to have a well-equipped kitchen separated by a door. It was very quiet, so was fine for working from home too. 

Very conveniently located for buses and MRT, and close to good food outlets. 

I didn__ use the gym and pool but they looked good. The apartments are not luxury or boutique style but a really good step up from a hotel if you want a slightly longer stay."
I__ give more than 5 stars if I could. Will definitely be back and highly recommend this place!
"This apartment and the hosts were great and very accommodating. We stayed for over a month and I felt pretty comfortable with the space. I think the response time to questions we had was the most impressive part. They also had someone do a quick cleaning every week! The apartment is also fairly well equipped, especially for it's size. Lots of storage space and your basic kitchen and kitchen stuff were provided. If you want to store refrigerated items the fridge was small but we rarely ate in so it wasn't a huge deal. The mattress wasn't the best but it also wasn't the worst. The biggest problem I can think of wasn't a host related problem but the unit is in a large building that is both shops and residences so the system to get to the apartment was a little more complicated compared to other places we've stayed. You needed a card to get up and down two sets of elevators and if you wanted something delivered the delivery person needs to be buzzed in from your unit. As a last note about the location it was actually connected by skybridge to an MRT station (Nicoll highway) which was really helpful for getting around. It was also very close to two bus stops, so alot of options for transportation. Thanks for the comfortable stay, it really helped make the trip the best!"
"Good location and nice place to stay 

Worth the value"
Bob place is perfect value and a great place to stay
"This was an amazing AirBnB-experience! It is modern, clean and neat (and it is even better than the pictures). The staff is very friendly, and the housekeeping is very thorough. We can recommend this stay to anyone visiting Singapore!"
Great place! Bigger than expected and such a nice touch to have a pool/gym in the building! Staff is very nice
"Incredibly quick drive from the airport. Very clean, contemporary space. Good facilities and amenities."
I would definitely recommend this apartment! Clean and welcoming staff!
A serviced apartment in a convenient enough location. $8 by taxi from the downtown. 15 min walk from Mountbatten MRT.
Great place!
"Would definitely stay again! Very clean, sufficiently spacious and helpful staff!"
"Een week verbleven in het appartement van Bob. Bij aankomst zag het er netjes en schoon uit en alle voorzieningen zijn aanwezig. Tijdens het verblijf wordt de kamer om de dag schoongemaakt en 1x per week schoon beddengoed, perfect!
Ongeveer kwartiertje lopen van de metro (handige lijn), kan eventueel ook met de bus er heen. Daarnaast zwembad en fitness aanwezig."
Great experience!
"I would recommend the place, even if it__ 5-10 Minutes walk from Mountbatten MRT station it is worth it. The place was super clean and the host very friendly."
Had a great stay at Bob's serviced apartment. Amenities and location where quite good and the pool and gym facilities were clean and functional. Lots of channels were available on cable tv but wifi was so-so.
"Great place, vale, service and regular cleaning was really! Would highly recommend, just be aware that food whether for home cooking or going out is a bus or grab away."
The location was great and the place was really clean!
"Clean, reasonably spacious and exactly as advertised."
"Super spacious place. Enjoyed the space a lot and loved having room cleaning 3x a week.

It's very close to 2 bus stops that basically brought us to every where we wanted to visit. 

The only issue is that we were in the 9th floor and still saw quite a few small ants crawling around. The place is very clean otherwise."
"The place is well located, taxis are better than public transport as they are near to main attractions like universal studios, etc. Host was very responsive and good. Not many nearby restaurants, so have to figure that out specially if you want to have quite bite in late night .."
Net appartement met  basis voorzieningen. Goed openbaarvervoer.
"Perfect place for Singapore. 868 meters door to door by foot from MRT Mountbatten.  Hawker center near MRT. ;-) Bus 30 every 10 minutes on front door to go direct to Sentosa and Vivocity or Jurong bird park (1.25 SIN dollar with EZ pass, one way). Bob is the kind of perfect host that everybody is looking for. 24 hr service. It's a place where they normally do long term lease so it's really reliable. They are well organized. AirBNB is just a way for them to get in contact with future client.  Take care, in the shower hot water is on the right side. Kitchen is really particle. And ultra clean pool. Really quiet place. A little far form any service but the idea is to use public transport in Singapore. Which is really the way to spend time in SIN. Easy access to airport with the MRT. I plenty recommended it and I'll go back there if I need to. See you Bob!"

Good and big place in a quiet neighborhood.
"Das Haus und das GÃ¤stezimmer sind gro_zÃ¼gig und sehr schÃ¶n.
Die Dusche ist wirklich super. 
Zwar liegt die Unterkunft etwas au_erhalb der Downtown, doch die gro_artigen Bus und Zugverbindungen in Kombination mit gÃ¼nstigen Nahverkehrstarifen lassen das schnell vergessen.

Good everything.

"Natasha and her family are really nice hosts. Their two girls are very well behaved and friendly. It's great to see kids not glued to electronic devices that can socialise :) 

The house is really beautiful, and seemingly cleaned all the time. The neighbourhood is a quiet residential area which is what we wanted. Unfortunately we were on a very busy schedule and did not get to spend more time with the host family. 

Really can't ask for more. Thank you!"
"A lovely place that is clean, comfy and absolutely stylish! Even if it's quite faraway, it's definitely worth it."
Spacious room enough for three people and three suitcases! Natasha was easy to communicate and she helped us checking in even when we arrived quite late. Bus station is less than 5min walk so it was easy to travel to places.
"Natasha was a good host, the house is very nicely decorated and inside quiet. The room was big enough, the bathroom spacious."
Good
"Natasha is a fantabulous host . She has a beautiful place , good amenities , easily accessible place as it is very near to bus stand. Natasha is a great help whenever there is a query ,she was always quick in response n helping in the best possible way. Had a great experience ..she made our stay quite easy and comfortable. Highly recommended ."
Big room. Great location near bus stop that takes you to Clementi MRT station. Quiet neighborhood.
"Location is a bit far from the city but since the bus stop is no near, makes up for it. There are no near places to eat that is walking distance so make sure to eat out if you want. The host was so nice and such a great conversationalist. Will recommend!"
"This place is superb!!! with private pool, very greeny environment, the feeling of staying there is so comfortable that you really feel yourself home. I will definitely like a house like this Thanks!"
I would recommend Natasha's place for its location and convenience to anyone who intends going to Singapore for a short or long stay
"wonderful place, very beautiful"
lovely!!
"We stayed just one night while being in transit on our way back to Europe. 

The room was good and as described but the location is a bit far from city center to enjoy it on a short duration. 

We did not meet Natasha and her family during our short stay."
"Close to bus stand. Good neighbourhood. Lovely dogs,  cute daughters,  Natashas spouse is very friendly."
Natasha's house is a spacious and cozy stay and the family is very nice and reasonable.   Pls don't be shy to ask for the needs with the housemates which they maybe sometimes busy ;-)
Excellent choice to stay in Singapore. The host was really helpful and the property is fantastic.

We stayed 5 days and commuting was very convenient with bus and MRTs. Easily accessible to all the attractions and we used the bus and MRTs with nets flashpay card.
Other guests were there at home, but we didn__ face any issues in sharing kitchen.  They have 2 maids. Maids helped us in buying groceries when requested and very helpful in tying the dogs when we enter and leave the house. 

Highly suggested in Singapore."

Nice and comfortable place
"It's a very lovely home with ver accommodating, genuine and friendly hosts."
"Nice place!  We stayed only one night because this is our stop over from our trip in Europe, but we enjoyed the pool and their neighborhood.  Hope to stay here again next time we will visit Singapore."
Although we faced some issues during check in but Natasha solved the problems immediately. The house is big with three lovely dogs and big pool. My daughter enjoyed the pool so much. The location easy to find with nice food nearby. This place is nice to stay for short or even long vacation
Verry beautiful house with kind hosts but noisy because of the proximity of the speedway
A very nice host! :) Place is very stylish and very clean. Would recommend and come back if I__ around the Clementi area.
nise house !!!
Lovely and safe place. Highly recommended for family of 3.
"Maison trÃ¨s agrÃ©able dans le quartier Clementi, propre et chambre avec climatisation ce qui est indispensable vue la chaleur, la maison est loin des attractions de Singapour mais il y a un arrÃªt de bus qui vous y amÃ¨ne (50 min de transport), la communication n__st pas au top sur l__rganisation de la maison mais on s__dapte!"
A very nice home with great owners who are very hospitable!
"Comfy and clean, awesome ambience. Great place to rejuvenate. 3 friendly dogs is a plus. Wish we can stay longer."
"A beautiful home, family and city. We loved our stay and time in Sinapore so much, made extra special by Natasha's generosity and kindness. Our kids had lots fun playing together in the pool and in their home - life long memories.  Getting around Singapore was easy with Grab. Thank you again for everything.  We hope we can come back!"
This place is well connected with public transportation and you can easily roam around the city. The house was super clean and we had great stay here!
"Unfortunately, I am disappointed the room letting. 
1. The room we were given was not what was advertised on your profile at the time I booked - it was inaccurate. The room was completely different to the advertised room that I paid for. There were too many storage articles in the room. It did not seem very guest friendly. The bedsheet also had a few holes and I did not feel okay as I had bought my senior parents to a holiday and the sheets were like that. 
2. The air conditioner was not working properly, if at all it was working. When we raised this concern with your help in your absence - we were told it was like this. We could not bear the heat at night and the move on the last day was because of this. 
3. We were not given the privacy we required as there was no two way lock in the room and after we had our belongings inside, the help entered to organise/clean anyway.
4. The WiFi did not work at all. I had to use personal mobile credit for data. It was very hard to communicate important things that were urgent in nature. 
5. The host was very good in messages and responsive but totally opposite in person."
"A really nice place located centrally in Tanjong Pagar. Very close to MRT.
The apartment was nice. Perfect for 1-2 persons :)"
"Quick response, good service and stressless stay."
"Everything was fine until checking out. It was a public holiday, thus I didn__ know I had to have a permit From the condo to move out. The security wouldn__ let my movers and lorry into the premises and let moving out take place as this would cause noise and complains from neighbours . Upon contacting the host, his advice was to hire a GrabCar to shuttle moving out. Eventually after discussions with security, I was able to move out. My stay was excellent , yazrin was a great help, assisting me during my stay. Cleanliness was good. Only problem was the last day checking out."
"A quiet, central location. Host was prompt in replying and helpful. I would highly recommend this place and would love to stay here again."
A great place to stay
"Everything as described, nice room and great swimming pool. The apartment is good located (in a walking distance to MRT) and well-equipped. I recommend it to everyone."
"Great stay.
Communicated well.
Nice host.
Son took care of me.
Good space.
Nice value for Singapore.
Further from airport by Public trans then I was thinking, but taxi time is good."
"very nice place. the host is very responsive to queries and can help with other concerns such as booking of cab, etc."
"This place is a nice location, a short walk to metro station and a main shopping mall. The room is small, good for a short stay and has a very nice pool"
Will comeback stay here for sure when i visit singapore
Sangat membantu untuk mendapatkan tempat tinggal yang nyaman dan murah
Good place to stay
"The son and his girlfriend were super courteous and helpful. They were truly thoughtful and full of traveling suggestions. Having use of the washing machine was bonus! 
Thank y__ll so much for your hospitality!"
Nice place for a few days. Great pool
Host replies quite fast to queries. Very accommodating.
Don't expect to get a warm welcome from the owner. Guy is busy being a teenager.
Owner family is very kind!!!
It was a pleasant stay here. Definitely recommended.
"Stayed here for 4 days and Shangping is an excellent host, she communicates fast and is very helpful. The place is exactly how it looks and very clean. The MRT is about 10-15 mins by foot (i enjoy walking so i dont mind) the place is quiet, so I slept well. I would definitely stay here again once I comeback. Thanks Shangping!"
"The place had a great pool and the mattress was comfortable. The things I found not mentioned were:
_ Wifi was weak or non existent if I stayed in my bedroom, the sitting room had no light, a/c and the girlfriend was miffed to see me so I stayed away.
_ hygiene was poor
_ the son lives there with his girlfriend and they come and go at different times so you never know if you're alone or not. There were lots of bumps and noises that sounded from one of the rooms.
In his defense, on the rare occasion that he did speak to me he was friendly and courteous. I think this is something his mum wants him to do and he'd rather not have to deal with people in his flat."

"everything is good, although have a distance from MRT, but you can enjoy to see lifestyle of Singaporean. Recommended to stay if you free and easy alone in Singapore."

"Lovely, cozy place in hougang. Good time away from the hustle and bustle of the city, although the hougang bus terminal is a big one, so you can easily get buses to all parts of the country"
"The apartment is in a good location, only a $15 taxi ride from the airport and the city. The host was very helpful and responded to emails within in minutes. I could store my luggage on the last day as my flight was only late in the evening. Really enjoyed the pool. Perfect to relax and to enjoy a warm Singapore afternoon."

The host were very friendly and helped me with all my wishes and questions. I enjoyed the fabulous pool. I can recommend this accommodation for a single traveler.
"The accommodation was ok - I have stayed in nicer, more central places in Singapore for less though. The bathroom didn__ feel very clean - I__ not sure whether it was just very stained, or dirty but I didn__ want to put my stuff down in there. There wasn__ a sheet on the bed and I was just given a fluffy blanket to sleep under - it was the type you wouldn__ normally wash very often so it stayed fluffy, which made me wonder if it had been washed after the last guest. 
It is a little bit of a walk from the nearest MRT - this didn__ bother me but could be a sticking point for other people. It__ also on a line where you have to change three times in order to get to the airport. 
Good points - it was very quiet, you had use of the kitchen, the shower had good pressure and the pool looked very nice. 
The place is fine if you just need a place to sleep and you__e going to be out all day, I wouldn__ have wanted to spend any more time there, and like I said, I think you can find more central places in Singapore for this."

Nothing to say now.
"Smoking is allowed in the building, so you might end up in a room smelling of cigarette smoke (we only stayed a couple of nights, so I'm not sure there are any non-smoking rooms: up to you to ask). My partner noted that someone was smoking ""nearby""(?? we didn't leave any window open so this either means next door or in the hallway) and the smell periodically got stronger.

If you're sensitive to noise, I have to say that elevator makes a constant beeping sound every 30 seconds, all night long (I used earplugs and that fixed the problem). And currently there is construction going on right next door, which appears to be during the daylight hours. 

Other than that, it's a fairly quiet neighborhood near the main street, with lots of food options and quite close to the airport. Staff are very kind and friendly. Wifi is decent and reliable."
Amazing pool. Beautiful condo. In a great location. The place is very new. Everything is super clean and beautiful.
Very good stay. Thx

"The house has a lot of space. Suitable for family living, not crowded. The things in the room are arranged neatly, the hygiene is clean, there is no garbage or dust, and the bedding is clean, which makes me very satisfied. The landlord and housekeeper are also very good. They can communicate with each other in English and Chinese smoothly, and reply very timely. They give a lot of travel Suggestions! I will stay here next time I come to Singapore."
"The house is satisfied, the room is clean and sanitary, the wireless network signal is strong, the landlord is enthusiastic, worth staying in! Recommend to everybody!"
"The rooms are large and clean.There is a swimming pool downstairs, and the transportation is convenient. It is very convenient to take a taxi and take the subway. The landlord is warm and patient, and gives us a lot of help in our (Website hidden by Airbnb) you!"
"We had a great time at Linda's place. The location is convenient, next to Fort Canning Park. We appreciate that there are three separate rooms that we can each have our own privacy. One big room, two other rooms are smaller. We like the fact that the place is really clean. 

Linda is really quick in responding to our messages. She also offered free pick up to her place. Thanks for being a great host. Happy New Year!"

Location was convenient -- MRT station 10 minute walk, 2 bus stops within a 5 minute walk, a shopping center with a hawker center and minimarts about 5 minutes away as well, and a short drive to the downtown core."
"Hi Bob,

Thanks  for the upgrade, it was a great stay and comfortable place especially for my baby.. this place is highly recommended. 5 star is not enough,  its more than what we expect.. 

especial thanks to housekeeping who always accomodating my needs from time to time.. 

Receptionist are always friendly and helpful.. 

Thanks everyone!
Salamat....

See you next time"
Clean and outside of downtown. Take subway
"The location is very convenient and the householder's service is also very well. Totally, a nice experience."
Thanks for let us stay
The place is cozy and clean. Perfect for business trip or short term stay. Great housekeeping service. But there are not many shops and restaurants around.
"On check in, Bob explained that they have a renovation going on and to prevent us from any discomfort / noise during daily working hours, he gave us a free room upgrade to a larger room on 7th floor, which we greatly appreciated.

This is serviced apartment, so you get your room cleaned up 3 times a week. Quite handy!

Sleeping and bed were very comfortable. This is the best (and soft) bed we had on our trip in Southeast Asia. Air conditioning is quiet.

Location is quite good. There is a good connection to the Marina Bay and city center via bus and MRT. The bus station is just on the other side of the road, 1 min walk. There is hawker center with cheap food near, in like 3 min walk. 

Swimming pool and gym are not big - enough to accommodate 3-4 people I think.

Overall great value for money and we loved the place."

This is a great appartement in a perfect neighborhood. Host team very supportive.
We had originally booked a different apartment to this however as there were some issues with the air conditioning we were offered this place. Communication was smooth albeit could have been quicker and we were only notified of the change less than a week before our stay. Check in was easy and smooth and the place was really pleasant to stay in. We needed extra toilet paper the second day and the hosts helped deliver it very quickly. Overall a pleasant stay.

Nette saubere Unterkunft in der NÃ¤he von MRT. Gerne wieder.
"First, the location was excellent: near metro, restaurant and market. The apartement was just really like the ad but it__ really for 2 persons maximum. The apartement is really really small. We had all we need: towels, toilets paper, soap.

The negative points:
The air conditionner didn__ work. IT WAS SO HOT in this little place. This is the point that make us didn__ want to return in this apartement. Also, it has a bad odour the first day we arrived. Like I said, it__ a really small unit so it__ ok if you take the apartement just to sleep.

We had some issues finding the place. According to us, the information to find the place were not really clear but we had a really good communication with the host who help us finding the apartement."
"Book this place for the value and location. Reasonably cheap for the area, has a brilliant local/non-tourist market very close by, and bus and train stops within easy walking distance. Close proximity to Downtown Core and Sentosa is a huge plus, particularly for tourists like my wife and I. Be aware that the place is clean and modern, but very small. Overall, this is a very good deal, and I would book again."
Hans place is in a great location and provides you with everything that you need
"Great amenities. Quiet neighbourhood, yet still a lot of happenings nearby. The Studio is within 10 minutes walk of the MRT, and Supermarkets. Tiong Bahru Hawker is closer still. Recently renovated, modern decor. Nothing to worry about staying here."
Han was very informative before my stay. Everything in the description matched what the space/ location/ etc was. This spot is great for 2 people. The location was about an 8 min cab to Clarke Quay!
We had great time at the flat. It is nearby the Outrampark mrt and easy to walk
"Klein, maar alles wat je nodig hebt. Wasmachine, koelkast, magnetron, kookplaat, televisie & douche. Eenmaal gevonden is het eenvoudig binnen komen met de codes. Als je echt alleen een kamer nodig hebt om te overnachten is dit perfect. Als je houd van een kamer met een raampje waarin je je een beetje betrokken voelt bij de stad is dit een kippenhok. 
In ons geval gewoon goed."
"This place is nice. Close to Tiong Bahru Market, Outram Rd bus stop and Blok 55 Bus Stop. Room is a bit tight, but if you__e spending around 2-4 days with limited luggage I think it should be sufficient. Thanks to Han for the hospitality"
Great location. Everything you need
Good room condition. Quite good location
"Pulito, comodo per tutte le zone centrali e con un wifi perfetto. L'appartamento puÃ² risultare un po' piccolo ma bisogna considerare gli standard del posto"
Le studio est petit mais fonctionnel
This place has everything you need. Good location and communication.
"Han was a great host. The apartment is in the great part of the city, very close to the Chinatown. There are great restaurants and food markets in the neighbourhood. 
But I would not call it luxurious,  as it was pretty simple."
Han was an amazing host. With very quick response times if you need help. I would stay with them in the future!
"Hans place was nice! It is very very very small. Suitable for really only one person. The air condition works great but make sure you close the room door. Very safe & friendly neighborhood! I wouldn__ stay here again just because of how small it was, but if the room was bigger I would! Han was very fast with communicating as well!"
Super sejour! Han est trÃ¨s reactif et toujours pret _ nous aider
Great place!
"Das Apartment von Han ist ein idealer Ausgangspunkt nach Chinatown und liegt in fu_lÃ¤ufiger NÃ¤he zur nÃ¤chsten U-Bahn-Station (10-15min). Es gab auch die MÃ¶glichkeit, das GepÃ¤ck nach Anmeldung am Anreisetag oder vor Abreise bei Han abzustellen. Schickes Apartment, etwas klein aber vollkommend ausreichend fÃ¼r 2 Personen. Gerne wieder in Singapur!"
"Great location, very clear arrival instructions and very responsive host, good amenities"
"Amazing location, not far from downtown. My wife and I loved the cozy space"
"Godt omrÃ¥de, med hyggelige cafÃ©er. Omkring 20-30 minutter til centrum, nemt med metro. Fin lille lejlighed"
The house was as pictured. Clean and located well near cafes and public transportation. There was some miscommunication upon checkin but was resolved quickly.
"It__ clean and stylish but it__ really small. I stayed there for 2 nights with my husband.

1. Upon check in we find a difficulty in finding the entrance to the unit because the link they send didn__ work. (I need to check it beforehand for next time I guess). But after we contact the host, she__ kind enough to guide us through and send us another link despite it__ past midnight when we checked in. Thanks for that!!

2. It__ really really small. There__ no space for us to open our luggage (we had 2 hand carry luggage); in the end we need to put it on top of the table.

3. At first, we thought there__ no hot water but turns out there__ a button to turn on the water heater near the sink, so it__ all good.

4. The TV didn__ work for us. I__ not sure if it just doesn__ work or there__ supposed to be another button for it to turn on like the water heater, oh well.

Overall, it__ an okay experience considering we only need to stay there for 2 nights. But the space definitely have a great modern design though!!"
Great location. Stylish and clean.
"Great location, great space! Han was very helpful with his video guide on how to get to the apartment, great help! Would recommend 10/10"
Great location. Clean and cozy little apartment.
We really enjoyed our stay! We found it was a great location for getting around different parts of Singapore. We loved the small town vibe of the streets around the apartment. Thank you for the quick responses and the lovely stay.

Nice room and a nice place to stay. Useful free shuttle bus to MRT. Nina is very friendly and helpful
This is the best accommodation you__l have in SG if you__e on a budget. The hospitality is top-notch. The housekeeper Mira is lovely. I was already checked out but she still let me wash my clothes and even drink tea in the dining room.
"Without any doubt, this is my new place to stay whenever I visit Singapore. Easy to check in and checkout. I super love the location. It's just walking distance to Kallang station. The caretaker is nice and kind. And the owner is very responsive to messages on Airbnb.  The place is quiet and has just enough number of guests to the place. The bed is comfortable, and the bathrooms, though a bit small for others, just enough size for me. I truly appreciate that the bathrooms are complete on its own with sink, toilet and hot and cold shower. They provide toiletries and clean towel. They have washing machine, too. They provide breakfast: bread, cereal, spread, coffee, and tea. This is also available throughout the day, or up until supplies last. They do not have a stove, but they do have microwave oven, oven toaster, refrigerator, and hot and cold water dispenser. This listing is definitely worth the money. Give it a try!"

"3 min walk to Kallang MRT Station.
Clean room with free breakfast.
Convenient self-service check-in.
Really nice place to stay for a single traveler "
"Stylish space, clean and comfortable. There were basic snacks in the pantry - cereals, biscuits, bread, kaya jam, peanut butter, strawberry jam, etc, so if you arrive super late like I did you can still have a bite. It's also at the edge of Geylang and my local friends said there were lots of good food places nearby, though I didn't have time to explore.

The front entrance is a little hidden, I took a Grab car over and went to the wrong capsule hotel first next door but they pointed me to the right side. After that check-in was quick and easy.

I was lucky, everyone in the hostel was very respectful of the space, so it was quiet and I could rest well. A little dental kit is provided which was great, since I forgot my toothbrush.

Would definitely stay again."
A really nice place to stay in Singapore. Everything is close by the Trainstation is only a 5 Minutes walk. And the Breakfast is a bonus. I would stay here again
Awesome location and convenient to have breakfast. Would definitely stay here again.
Great place
"Thanks! Great place, well-located"
"The place is exactly as advertised. Don't expect anything too fancy, this is a typical capsule hostel (exactly what is claims to be!) The location is great, being close to the train with a short journey into the city centre. Breakfast was provided and the room was clean when I got there. I had no issue with my stay and would highly recommend the place to anyone ! You won't get anything else this good for the price !"
Sweet little place. Definitely a good stay.
"Clean, friendly, and comfortable environment! Will be staying here again when I come to Singapore again"
Clean a simple.
"Very responsive host!  There is a construction site on the opposite side of the street, I wouldn't recommend to people who are sensitive to poor air quality."
"Really cozy and clean hostel, people are friendly to each other, food in kitchen are supplemented timely"
good!
Derrick__ place is pretty sweet! Super close to the Kallang train station and next to a 24 hr restaurant! Only downside was the construction going on in the area but obviously not a reflection on the stay! Would recommend without a doubt.
Really nice place with warmhearted hospitality!

"Great location !  Just around 150m, 3 mins walk from Kallang Station, 8 - 9 stations away from Changi Airport. The hostel is clean and tidy !  Will definitely stay here again on my next visit to Singapore."
"Location and cleanliness is acceptable. 
 it is mix room and noisy is expected"
"Nice and clean hostel with plenty of breakfast available all day. The place is within 5 minutes walking distance from Kallang MRT station. From the airport, using MRT it took me about 1/2 hour to get there. The bathroom and bedroom are clean with plenty of hot water for shower. Sleeping area got fairly warm around midnight after everybody is asleep (perhaps thermostat set too high). Breakfast is available all day. Towel is provided. I feel safe. Located next to a pub and some local restaurants. Good value, and good proximity to Changi airport. Allow at least 1/2hr travel time using MRT between Airport and the hostel."
Quite decent place and worth the pricd
Very clean and nice place
Convenient location and super cute and clean.
"Nice stay, close to airport"
Good
Great stay
Exactly what it says on the tin!! Clean comfortable with hot showers!! Everything I needed
Simply great
"Derrick__ place was clean and in a convenient location, needless to say far cheaper than pretty much anything else in Singapore (though I did not research that many hostels)
Overall a very pleasant stay and good value for money!
I did not know that the hostel is unmanned and that the shower and toilet are in the same space, but this is really not such a big deal, if you consider the other pluses.
Just mentioning it as the only two things that surprised me slightly."
Nice cozy place in singapore with reasonable price
Good place to lie down for one night or few.  MRT station close by. All day breakfast is a plus.  100% value for money.
Thank you for the hassle free stay. The ameneties are better than expected!
An amazing place to rest up. Not a lot of storage for luggages. But very clean.
Very responsive host. Easy self-check in. Fast wifi connection. Free all day breakfast. All that you need in a home is there. Near the mrt. Posh interior design. I really like it!
I really recommend the11room as a nice stay in Singapore. Very comfortable bed with breakfast and clean showers and kitchen! Thanks again :)
"The pods are designed really well, you have everything that you need including some hangers, small storage for toiletries or other items you want quick access to, and a charging spot. The pods are really close to each other and you will hear other guests, especially those arriving late or leaving early. if you are a light sleeper bring eag plugs. Close to MRT and some great food options close by. 

Despite this, we didn't have the best stay here. Since the space is small, your experience really depends on who else is staying here. We had other guests showing up after 11pm sitting in the sleeping area talking very loudly. Also, the street is a construction zone right now. The 2 days we were here they started work at 6:30am. We also found the staff around the house during the day rather rude and unhelpful."
"Pros: Good location, really well designed pods, easy check-in, close to MRT, ideal location for a few days of exploring the city, good local food options in neighbourhood. 

Cons: currently there is major construction going on- work started around 630am both days we were there; experience really depends on other guests- we had a group showing up past midnight and talking loudly in the sleeping area; if you are a light sleeper bring ear plugs!"
Clean and stylish place. Great for a place to relax and sleep. Good amenities too
"My first capsule experience and it was pretty outstanding. Didn__ know what to expect but it was extremely comfortable and very private too considering the style of the hostel. 

Luckily for me most of the people staying were very considerate and respectful so getting a good night__ sleep was very easy and pleasant. 

The facilities available were clean and very convenient - with breakfast bits like cereal, jams, and bread all readily available for people to help themselves. 

I had an overall great stay here, in fact one of the best places I stayed at in terms of sleep and comfortability in my stay in Sg. I recommend you try for yourself if you__e never experience a capsule hostel. Derrick is a great host."
"Nice and clean place which is close to public transport. There are also eateries  nearby. Self check-in was easy and hassle free. Made few good friends here. Thanks, Derrick."
"Great place. It__ very close to Kallang MRT. The check in process is very simple. The beds are comfortable. The capsule is a little bit more spacious than it seems in the photos. The bathrooms were satisfactorily clean considering it being a shared bathroom. 
Overall, would recommend if you want to get a place close to the airport for overnight transfers."
"After loads of walking it was nice to come back here for rest. I slept great and appreciated the extra pillow and bath towel. Not much of a common space. Breakfast was cereal but it was nice to have all day access in case I got hangry. Also, the space was always cold and the ac worked great. A must for hot days in Singapore!"
"So close to the Kallang MRT station, this place is incredibly clean and comfortable."
Pleasant stay
Good place to stay.
Good place to stay
"Lots of great things to say about Derrick and his place. First, i love the location. It__ near to the mrt station. Second, i love the warm hospitality. Derrick is so responsive. He addressed every concern as fastest as he can. Third, the place is so clean and well airconditioned. Fourth, there__ a free breakfast. You can eat until supplies last. And lastly, his Cleaner is amazing, very kind and sweet. I will surely stay in this place again once i get back to singapore. _¥ï_"
The location is ok. Near metro and bus. I didn't know It is  a mixed room. I stayed at the Upper bed. It is so high. I Need to struggle to climb up each time. Clean environment. People are quiet and polite. The street outside is not particularly charming.
"I arrived earlier but I was allowed a bed to stay as no one was there. Needed a room quick and got a very quick response via airBNB.
However, Kitchen is REALLY smelly, like milk that has gone sour. No hot water in shower. 
Bedroom area is quite nice and airy. Excellent location to the MRT. 
3.5/5 because of the bad kitchen smell..."
"The place is much better than I expected. It__ a value for money booking. Stylish, clean, spacious and near the MRT station. The amenities are top notch. I will definitely come back. Thank you for the awesome and responsive host for making sure all our concerns are addressed."
Over all good stay for price.thanks
"Great place, perfect for visiting Singapore if you plan to be out and about most days!"

A good location and nice space for the price- would recommend :)
Great accomodation.
"The pod is spacious than I expected. I just have difficulty in going up the ladder as my bed is at the top, and not comfortable with other guests snoring. Other than that, everything went well. Definitely worth the budget."

Good place and close (4 MRT stations till Bayfront ) till main attraction
A great place to stay! Recommended
good host good place to stay!
Value for money. Very accessible.
Was an amazing place. Value for money.
"A quiant and simple capsule stay with an insanely affordable price. It's close to the MRT station which pretty much gets you anywhere you need to go, and there were lots of good eats around the area too!"
It was far better than I expected. Will surely stay here again if I go back to Singapore near Kallang area. Everything was great.
"The 11 Room is right next to the MRT train station that quickly takes you all over Singapore with a map you can pick up right near your bedroom,if it__ a cab you need walk 20 steps and hale one , the food is great and always plenty there ,
my bed was so comfortable was thankfully on the bottom I__ 60 traveling alone at no time did I feel myself or my belongings unsafe in this space the curtains to close into your private world were a blessing as the fan and aircon could get to me and made sleeping very comfortable, this had been some concern when choosing places I__ so glad I didn__ go for a closed hard door pod ! 
slippers are provided to help not to disturb other guests , the bathroom is well supplied the only thing that was hard ,the floor is constantly wet so to just use the toilet was a small issue ,
The next door units are under construction and working during the day they stop at night you would find this staying in the most expensive accommodation in Singapore it__ a growing vibrant wonderful city 
I will return and refer anyone wanting a way to be safe comfortable and save money while traveling in Singapore well done Derrick and your cleaner Rosa"
The place was clean and quiet. The location is great for getting around. Multiple large bus stops and right next to the kallang station on the green line.

"Great location, functional space. Will definitely be back again!"
The pod is nice and clean. Derrick is responsive and provides you detailed instructions on how to check-in. No-frills and good location (near kallang MRT station).
A cosy little place at a convenient location.
"Limpio, fresco, el nombre del anuncio y el del lugar son distintos pueden causar confusiÃ³n"
"Great place. I__ say that not all beds are equally air conditioned (only one machine at one side of the room) and if you__e overweight/short/generally not fit request a bottom bunk. I__ 6_4 retired pro athlete and I had troubles getting to top bunk! Only two showers and toilets for up to 16 people, but does what it says on the tin. I__ stay again."
"Clean, convenient, and value for money place!"
"A good place to stay in Singapore 
Easy access to the city and to the airport.I can recommend also to the new comers here to stay"
Good hosting
Great place to stay with needed amenities and roommates. It's really close to the MRT station and a few restaurants.
"I was traveling through Singapore, so just needed a place to crash. It was super clean and close to metro, everything I needed that night! Would totally stay again and recommend. Thank you!"
"Absolutely loved this little place!! Very homely, very stylish, I felt very comfortable and home. So many ammenities and extra touches I didn__ expect :)"
About what you can expect from a hostel. Derrick was quick and responsive.
Good place to stay at Kallang

"The beds are super comfortable. The bathrooms are super clean and nice. It__ a nice space overall. Also the location is so close to the city center. If you__e looking to avoid those high hotel rates, I would highly recommend staying somewhere not too far out of the city and then taking the subway in, like this place. No complaints."
"Had a good stay. Good value for money, seamless check-in, the beds are private enough behind the curtain."
"A very accessible location just a minute away from a station along the Changi Airport line! Getting in was easy and for my second ever experience of capsule/hostel accommodation it was pretty nice! Private lockers, good showers and basins.

My only criticism is with getting into the top bunk - I'm right handed and there was no way to pull myself up with my right hand. Also the rungs themselves are quite hard and narrow so they do hurt feet that have been walking all day.

The guests were also very respectful and kind - something I was anxious about"
Derricks place was the first hostel my 75 year young dad stayed at. He had an amazing time there. He did ask me to mention about all the supplies Derrick has in store for his guests. Excellent place to stay. Thank you
"Great place to stay for any stay in Singapore. Central, comfortable and clean. If you are so fortunate to get a spot, go for it!"
Nice place to stay in Singapore
"It's everything you need. The facilities are great and the place is well maintained. It's  very quiet, the guests seem to be a calm bunch."
"This is a great choice for the traveler, very clean convenient and quiet for taking a rest"
"This place is ideal for solo travellers or a small group of friends. The location is incredibly convenient, being less than a minute walk to the train station, as well as local food just downstairs. The amenities are excellent, with 24 hr breakfast and an assortment of tea and coffee. There are also comfortable spaces in the kitchen and the main area to do work on your laptop. However this place is also good for travellers who just need a bed to rest their head at the end of the day.

The bathrooms are clean and the water heater works very quickly. However, as there are only two communal toilet/showers, there__ a small chance you may have to wait your turn if you need to use it during any __ush hour_ periods. Based on my experience, I only had to wait for the bathroom once, so it__ not a big deal."
"Good place to stay for a few days. Easy check-in and communication, comfortable bed, aircon works well, tea/coffee/bread for breakfast is provided, nice staff. But there are only two bathrooms for up to 16 people, which is not really convenient. 
Definitely bring ear plugs and perhaps a sleeping mask!"
"Overall, I had a great stay! It was a little difficult to find, even the cab driver didn't know where it was so I had to walk around for a bit using (Hidden by Airbnb) maps to try to find the side alley it was located in. I suggest logging onto wifi at the airport and starring the hostel location so even when you are walking around without wifi, you can see if you're going in the right direction. Another thing that caught me off-guard was that families with small children were also accommodated in this hostel, which I found strange to have backpackers and families sharing the same space. It made it difficult to sleep when the kid cried at night or when they were up early in the morning having loud conversations and playing games with their kid. Other than that, I had a great stay and found the amenities very comfortable. I would stay here again and recommend it to friends!"

Great place to stay for a quick trip! Clean and comfortable. Also had lockers to store belongings and some small breakfast items which was an added bonus!
Clean and convenient stay! Would recommend
I didn't get the chance to stay with Derrick because there were complications with my flight.  I never made it to Singapore unfortunately.
"This place blow my expectations out of the water. It's so great and cozy, and also very strategic because it's very close to Kallang MRT station. The host, Mr. Derrick, is very communicative and helpful too! Additionally, I get to met and befriend some of the coolest people from around the world that also happened to stay here! Will definitely go back here again in the future when I'm back on Singapore!"
"My first time in a hostel and it was very nice. I loved the curtain privacy, prompt communication, I had my clothes washed and hung to dry. I felt safe and it had all the essentials you need. Very comfortable and a great deal to stay in Singapore."
"Location near to mrt only 3 minutes , nearby have many restaurants"
Perfect place for a visa run with budget
For the same amount of money I stayed at a different capsule and was able to have a good proper breakfast (this place doesn't have a proper breakfast and if you wake up late it's really just some bread and there's not a regular toaster but rather a toaster oven). This place only has 2 small bathrooms where the showers/toilets are and it is always a mess in there. The floor doesn't properly dry and it's in need of an update in terms of tiles and all that. The actual bed itself is fine and is comfortable. Wouldn't stay here again tho if I had the choice just due to the bathrooms/breakfast. But there is free laundry too so that's nice.
â­
"If you're lucky, you will share the room with quiet and respectful people, who will respect your sleep. Your experience here will therefore be positive, for the place is ok. But I was not lucky. I cannot stay I got much sleep in 11room. Please people, if you're prone to snoring, please don't drink beers before going to bed in a shared dormitory, it makes things worst."

Two seperate lockable storage places, big enough for large bags and luggage.

Simple breakfast. Cereal and toast.

"PROS
*Convenient location from the airport. Super easy on the train

*Good communication and directions. Derrick helpful when I had issues with the access codes. Sent a staff member to help straight away.

CONS
*No staff on site.

*Strong stale beer smell in sleeping area.

*Only 2 toilets/showers for potentially 16-18 persons.

*One exit/entry. Back stairs blocked in the day. Door padlocked at night. Effectively NO FIRE EXIT.

Cannot recommend."
Good place easy to find and close to the train
Perfect place if you need somewhere to crash for a night.
"Recommended. Good for value, a good place to live with. Gonna stay there again."
"The location was very convenient as Kallang MRT is right across the road. There's also a Fairprice nearby to buy all essential supermarket needs. The housekeeper does not speak good English and told me she couldn't do my laundry at night (even though laundry services are meant to be provided), so I spent extra money at Wonder Wash, which is also across the road. Old Chang Kee is next to the train station, so it's easy to grab a bite if you're on the go. The hostel provides cereal and snacks if you're planning to stay in. Overall, was a pretty good experience. The password for entrance changes every week, so keep that in mind if you're staying over the week/weekend. Overall, it was a good experience and a good place to stay short-term if you'll be out and about most of the day :)"
It__ a really nice place well located and maintained
"Derrick's place is my go-to at this point. I've stayed twice, and both times have been awesome. Clean place in a great location for an amazing price. Definitely rent this place."
"Sure the place is great.  However,  never made it because of complications with the out of norm,  not my control or any ones control with the virus. Wouldn't budge or even consider a refund, date exchange or anything. Gave 2 star because very friendly and professional"
"Loved staying here. So clean, close to everything and outstanding hospitality. Would not hesitate to stay here again."
Overall it__ clean and the location is okay.
Convenient location to access to public transport....the place is clean and well taken care..overall is satisfied
Good place to stay at. Really close to the train station.
"Excellent location next to mrt
Huge space and comfortable environment"
"Great capsule place and the most surprise me is laundry service because you just need drop at your own place and cleaner will self collect and done it for you without any charger. 
Within 5minute walking distance for MRT station and other public transport is convenience too. 
Will come again~"
Dope hostel!
Thank you so much
"Everything was excellent, clean, convenient location, excellent service, I recommend!"
worth the value
Host are one of the kind!
This is a nice place to use as a locker room style. The upside is extremely close to all the major locations if you want something simple and close to the city highly recommended place
"Overall is okay such as  a quick service response. But, there are some ants inside the room. That's mean the room is not totally clear"
"Amazing studio apartment in a luxurious new development, City Gate. What an oasis retreat in a central neighborhood."
"This apartment is new, and as expected very clean, with weekly housekeeping service. The location is excellent.  Our host is responsive to requests, so no complaints.  The double bed is firm and comfortable, but it's in the loft, and the space is small, and may not be suitable for older folks. But the stairs are broad enough and safe.  Value is good, and worth the small compromise."
Amazing location to get started in Singapore. Easy to reach MRT and great food choices around apartment.
"This is a newly renovated apartment in conserved Tiong Bahru heritage residential neighborhood, refreshing to see the mix of old and new apartments here within an old peaceful neighborhood. Bus stop merely 20 steps away, mrts 5 min walk, well located. nice window view from this bedroom. Little shops like 7-11, cafes and all the famous affordable food in the big Tiong Bahru market is impressive and enjoyable. My GF enjoys it a lot."
"Great location, clean and tidy place. You get your own bathroom and the place is spacious! Definitely worth the money. I highly recommend and will stay here when I return in future!"
Near from central area. Convenient. Kind and gentle staffs.
Loved the place _¤ï_
"The location was very convenient. It__ a pretty central location right by the famous Orchard road. Somerset station is a short walk away. There__ a 24 hr market at the end of the block, and the popular Killiney Kopitiam is just around the corner as the street the apartment is on connects with Killiney Road. 

The place was generally clean, but I did have to ask for the sheets to be changed as soon as I checked in, and there were signs of wear around the apartment such as a large water stain on the ceiling. While the place was dusted/vacuumed, it just didn__ feel sparkling clean. But it was fine. 

My biggest issue was with the A/C_ it__ directed right over the bed. It had a slightly musty smell at times, and it was directed right over the bed, so if you sleep with it on, you__e getting A/C air directly on you. I ended up getting sick my first night, and while I wasn__ so sick that it ruined my trip, exposure to direct air from an A/C unit is not healthy. 

The staff was very friendly, and the host was highly responsive, so that was all good. The place was affordable, and like I said, location is really prime. But I don__ think I__l be staying here again."
"I had a very pleasant stay at Abe__ place.
She helped me a lot and thanks to the guy on the night shift who always greet us kindly and help us for everything we need! I will definitely back to this place for my next trip to SG."

Lovely place close to Orchard Road! Can sit and enjoy the ambience and then walk home after your tired.
"Clean place, convenient location near lots of shopping and restaurants within walking distance -- all at a great price. Would definitely recommend!"
Excellent location!
"Absolutely amazing location! Close to grocery, 100s of restaurants, bus stops & Somerset train station, HopOn-HopOff pickups, shopping malls & more! We stayed 6 days & loved it!"
Outstanding on all parameters: extremely happy with this stay and can recommend it in particular to couples / small families who want to be situated smack in the middle of town.
"The positive: the location is incredible. Orchard Road and lots of restaurants are within walking distance. It's a five-minute walk from Somerset MRT station and two different bus stops, and getting around the city from this location is very easy. It took us about 20-30 minutes to get to the more downtown areas, depending on exactly where we were going. My wife and I ate at the Killiney Kopitiam right down the road 6 out of 7 mornings we were in town. If you stay here, you have to try that place. The kaya toast and white coffee are awesome and a must-try. I can't say enough about the location. The staff were courteous and generally helpful. 

The not-so-positive: the place was definitely adequate, but also felt very basic. As other reviews have mentioned, the A/C unit does blow right over the bed, so with the thin covers provided, things can get chilly at night. Maybe you can ask for more covers - I didn't try. The only toiletry provided is one soap dispenser in the shower that dispenses an all-in-one shampoo/conditioner/body wash/hand soap. We asked the front desk about it and they gave us more traditional hotel-style shampoo and soap bottles. Cable TV was advertised, but not available in our room (a TV was provided). None of these are deal-breakers, they just contributed to the overall ""no-frills"" vibe of the experience. 

The neutral: it seemed in the pictures listed that maybe there was a separate clothes washer and dryer in the room, but ours came with one washer/dryer unit. There is no kitchen sink even though there is a kitchen area, and housekeeping comes twice a week. Instead of paying for bottled water, we refilled water bottles using tap water from the bathroom sink. That may gross you out, but it tasted fine, we didn't get sick, and we saved a bunch of money  on drinking water (as opposed to buying bottled water). Do that at your own risk, but it worked for us.

Bottom line: if I couldn't find anything of a better value, I'd definitely stay here again. The price we paid seemed a little steep for what we got, but maybe that's just Singapore or this area in particular (this was our first visit to Singapore, so we don't have any other experiences to compare it to). The location is definitely the main drawing point. If you're looking for a pretty cheap place and plan to be out seeing the sites most of the time you're in Singapore - I'd heartily recommend this one. The ease of taking public transportation from here cannot be overstated and is a huge plus. If you're more wanting a place to chill and spend time relaxing - I'd look somewhere else further away from downtown."
"Absolutely great location, very convenient to grocery stores and shopping centres. The check-in/out process was very easy and staff were prompt to help with any enquiries."
"Super clean and spacious place, helpful and nice host, informative and contacable."

"Jay__ place is super clean and comfortable, you could get everything you want in the room. The location is great, easily go to town center and other landscapes. It__ a new condo, has a big swimming pool and gym, I really had a good stay, definitely would come back again."
"This property is brand new and in great condition. It's stylish and has the basic needs for any stay. The location is within a 15-20 minute walk to the central area and there are many great places to grab a bite and explore right near CityGate. The bed was not the most comfortable, but somewhat standard for what one might find in Asia. It was easy to access the host anytime I had questions and they were good about letting me know about housekeeping, checkin and checkout."
The condo is brand new and clean.  The management team is experienced and provided comfortable service.
I absolutely loved staying here. I was worried about apartments in Singapore as I have heard they are small but this one was perfect for 2 of us. When we arrived the apartment was tidy and stylishly decorated. The amenities at the apartment building are also to high standard and new! I have quite high expectations and I am so happy that Jay was able to meet them and make my stay so comfortable. Thank you!
"The condo is in one of the best areas of Singapore with convenient access to transit to get yourself across the city. The condo reflects the description and photos and has amazing views of the city. One of the best features is the amenities: the pool, the relaxation areas and the gym - found on two full floors of the building. Jay and his team did a great job of tending to our needs."
Our long-term stay in Jay__ apartment upon arrival in Singapore was delightful. We will always have a great memory of our lovely City Gate apartment as our first place in Singapore!
"I stayed at Jay__ place for a month for work and couldn__ have wished for a better place! 2 min by foot from Arab street and Haji Lane, this place is a real gem. The place itself is very small but the outside areas (at 6th floor and 24th floor) deff make up for that, we often ate and worked there. The pool and gym areas are very clean and have all the necessary amenities. Would definitely stay here again!"
"Location is perfect, out door facilities excellent, public transport within 500 m range from building, eateries galore!"
They always provided professional services.  I will definitely come back to Jay again!!
"Team Jay was always very fast to respond, very kind and helpful in every request and issue and I can only highly recommend renting an apartment from them.

The apartment itself is very nice and stylish."
Amazing Condo with a lovely pool & chill area. 2 min walk to Arab street. I am looking forward to stay at Jay's place again.
"Good service, fast response! When I asked for an extra cover, they delivered brand new one for me! The building is amazing!"
The team was very nice and reply in time when anything pop out. Quite clean unit. I can highly recommend to stay there!
I really enjoyed staying here mainly because of location and cleanliness
"Amazing space, and location can't be beat. Jay and team were amazing in getting me settled. A memorable stay and I will definitely try and get this place again next time I am in Singapore."
"Quite suitable apartment for two who likes to explore the city, spend their time mostly outside, or stay fir an extensive period in Singapore. The location is excellent, as it only takes five minutes stroll to the nearest MRT station (Nicoll Highway) under a roofed walkway, so even in heavy rain one can get from A to B without getting soaked. There are plenty of restaurants in the next block at all styles, from gawker centre style to fine dining, or simply buying your own ingredients in a small supermarket. The amenities, e.g., swimming pool or training equipments are very nice to have. I can only recommend this place."
Great location and view from balcony towards the ocean. Pool is lovely. Block is safe and clean. Friendly accommodating host too! Just very small place. Especially in loft. You might bump your head and knees on the bed.
Good.

"Clean place that's close to MRT stations. Andrew will take good care of you. Just a couple of notes to consider...there's no common areas to hang out and there's one toilet and two showers for the 3-room hostile. Surprisingly, that wasn't really a problem when I was there. If you're okay with condensed living area, you'll be fine. Andrew is quick to provide clean towels and a clean area. He will also suggest places to visit in Singapore."
Kind and friendly hosts. good location and good for a short day sleep.
"Good hostel, I recommend it"

Good Location! Andrew is a very nice guy. Fast response and never make empty promise when you required somethings from him
I didn't really get to stay here due to an emergency buy nevertheless Andrew was really accommodating and thoughtful. He responds to questions timely. Will definitely book the same room the next time I come visit SG again.

"In case choosing to only for resting or overnight sleep at cheapest cost, that's place is good. Don't expect any extra amanities or huge space but ok and safe to sleep at night. Bathroom and bit small but clean."
"This is a great place if you want to explore Singapore on a budget. Its easily accessible through the MRT since Chinatown station is only five minutes away. There are a few good food options nearby at the People__ Park foodcourt. The hostel is mostly occupied by long term guests, but it was very nice chatting with them. Definitely recommend to stay here for a couple of nights."
"It's a very cute little place right in the center and perfect for travelers on budget and who likes to mingle and talk with other people ~
Andrew and the long-term stayers are all very familiar which each other and welcoming,  hence, even very small place, it's nicely comfortable."
"It__ pleased to get along with Andrew because he is an amiable person. The house is close to the downtown,you can easily go to the place you want."

Great location at an affordable price
Cheap stay in a good location. Lot of cheap shops and places to eat around.
ok
Very fast response
"The location of this apartment made my 2-month stay in Singapore extremely convenient. It__ located above popular hawker food centers and a mall, and right next to the Chinatown MRT station. I had no problems with the heat and water utilities in my room, which was a huge plus. Mr. K was a very responsive host and was quick to answer any questions I may have.

I also had a living room all to myself, separated from the rest of the suite by a heavy curtain. The bedroom itself is 100% private, so I keep my valuables locked in there instead of the living space. It was also really nice having my own refrigerator. I didn__ use the TV at all, but it was there just for me to use. The shower cubicle in the corner of my bedroom was also great...there are several others living in the apartment so if I had to use the communal shower it would have been far from ideal. The toilet and sink were communal and right outside my living space. Laundry machines were also right next to my living space and easily accessible but because of the other people in the apartment, it was often difficult to find it empty and free to use.

Overall, I really recommend this place to stay, especially given the location. It felt safe too, as there were guards downstairs in the lobby at all time to check the people entering the residential lifts"
"We really enjoyed our couple of months at Jay's place. Although there were some issues with the apartment from time to time, they were always fixed promptly.  The hosts were very friendly and responsive. This apartment is a bit further away from the CBD but for us, staying away from the crowds was perfect. Buses into town are very convenient, the hawker centre and surrounding restaurants are great. Our baby daughter really enjoyed the fantastic swimming pool, and the nearby playground (200 m)."

"Excellent customer service from booking to actually staying. Free airport transfer to the apartment was a great bonus and I felt informed of the necessities required to help my stay. Highly recommend the place for its nice location, close to China Town and MRT access."
"Z's place was a good landing spot for my business trip to Singapore. It had everything I needed, and Z was very quick to respond to my messages and questions. I appreciated the comfortable bed and the air conditioning. The location was very accessible and easy to get around. I definitely recommend!"

"I stayed for five days while visiting Singapore. The apartment is very clean and perfectly located above the MRT station. A five min walk away you'll find plenty of bars in Duxton Hill and Club Street, and street food @ Maxwell Hawker Centre. There's also an awesome rooftop pool directly outside the apartment.

Monica was very helpful and even provided me with a spare keypass on an hour's notice when I lost mine accidentally. I'd definitely stay again."
"Really great 1 bedroom apartment. Great central location. Apartment has all the basics that I needed during my stay with some nice added touches like lots of plug adapters. 

I didn__ use the complimentary airport pick up but would recommend using it for easier/check in. Otherwise I would recommend to coordinate on timing with the host in advance and let her know before leaving the airport as someone needs to help you get access into the building initially. 

The host was fast to respond to my inquiries during the stay. 

Save yourself some trouble and read the little notes left on some of the appliances. I didn__ read the one on the laundry machine before it was too late and I broke the handle. I felt terrible that I broke it but the host was very kind and able to get if fixed before the end of my stay without any inconvenience to me.

I enjoyed my stay and would stay here again!"
The location is very good.We enjoyed our stay.
Great location to get to MRT Outram station.
"Best part about the apartment was location. There's an MRT station just downstairs, so that made travelling a breeze. It's very quiet at night and we had very restful sleep. The space isn't too small and it's cozy. The apartment was also very well equipped with utensils and dishes. Would definitely stay again."

"Alex was responsive to messages and was flexible with our travel dates which was very helpful.

The best thing about this apartment is the location; it is on top of Outram MRT and in Chinatown. The pool access is on the same level which is very convenient.

Things to improve: decoration there is none.

Kitchen equipment: no coffee maker, cheap tea kettle which leaks when you pour, no cheese grater and bad knives.

Directions: there were not any for anything! A guest guide book is needed.

Local Guides: there weren__ any! Maps, business cards from restaurants, etc.

Furniture: it is too larger and awkward for the small space.

Pool towels 

To note: the apartment is in the Dorset hotel residences but you don__ register as an official guest, so the government may knock on the door and bug you; they tell not to answer. The government came twice during our stay."
Good location and amenities
"We had a great stay at Alex. He personally greeted us and showed us his place. The apartment's location is amazing. Just one stop from HarbourFront, which is where you catch the train to Sentosa.Loved the proximity to some great food outlets. Communication always prompt."
"The location is covenient.
very clean.  
The host is friendly and helpful! 
The response of host is quick and flexible.
The apartment has everything you could possibly need from the well appointed kitchen to loads of linen & towels to cleaning supplies & toilet tissue etc. 
I hope to stay in Alex's room when I visit Singapore again"
"Great place, nice view, friendly host."
"Alex's place was great! It was close to soo many restaurants! The place was very clean, and we had international tv and high-speed wifi.  Check-in was great. Alex gave us an early check-in and late checkout. He was also super responsive. The area was also just a good time. I totally recommend it."
"Amazing apartment! Clean, modern and great location. Would definately recommend!!"
"Great stay! The dryer takes a little longer than most American machines, but still a nice amenity!"
"The location of this place is perfect for getting around Singapore by MRT, you are right on top of the station and it is super convenient. Walking around Chinatown. Is super easy and within minutes you can be at all the hawker food centers. There are 4 / 5 in the area. There are also many small restaurants and convenient stores to get whatever you need. 

The apartment is cozy and they have provided all the necessary items you might need. The pool is nice and really close. We would definitely stay again if visiting in the future."
"The property was clean and very stylish. Great for young crowd as need to climb upstairs.  3 rooms were on higher floor and one room with living, dining and kitchen on same floor. The roof top on 3rd floor is great place to chill out provided it's not too hot. Car park available. Location just 10 mins to orchard street. Food and groceries shops just 5 mins away 10 to 15 mins walking distance away. Overall great experience."
Great unit for larger groups. Only con about this unit was the soundproofing which means you can hear a lot of neighbor and road noise so bring earplugs if you're sensitive. otherwise the unit and location are fantastic!
Nice apartment in a great location.  Clean and spacious.  Easy check in and on site concierge was very friendly.

We had a great stay in this apartment. It could have been cleaner and either a dishwasher or a plug so we could do the dishes would have been great. TV only had a couple of very average stations available and no ability to listen to music. We were still very comfortable staying here.

A rare find with an extremely polite and responsive host. The place is very clean and stylish with all the essential stuff. The bed is very comfortable and the furniture are all very new. This space even comes with a small kitchenette. The location is excellent. There are so many great eateries around and we even tried some on the Michelin list! Traveling about is convenient too as this place is extremely close to town. I would definitely stay at Kaurus__ place again!
"Excellent Location, place airy, clean and comfortable.  Even though the place is near to crowded malls and shopping center, please is quite and calm.  It is value for money, I will definitely recommend this place to my friends.  Thanks Hillary."
Great place to stay. Host is friendly and helpful. Place is near to major shopping complex in town.
"Excellent communication with owner - very quick response time, room & place (facilities) has everything you need for your stay, place is safe & quiet"
"The appt is located in a brand new apartment complex. The apartment is small, but includes all needed facilities. The pool is fantastic!"

The stay is all about the hoat and if your host is good you spend a great stay. And my stay was great
This is my first Airbnb stay and I must say that I am impressed. The place is very clean and the location is great with many good choices of food around. Moving around was convenient with many services of buses and the subway is nearby.
"Very good apartment. We have eight adults and three children in two two-bedroom apartments this time. The room is clean and tidy, and the kitchen and bathroom are clean . It's a little far from the subway station, but it's very convenient for us all to take taxis in Singapore, which is more cost-effective. Breakfast is slightly monotonous, but plentiful. The swimming pool is great. Will choose again."
Excellent for business travel.
"My first time booking with host chelsey. Although she's not there but his manager and cleaner are very responsive and helpful and assisted me after my self checkin after 7pm. It's a brand new apartment renovated, very nice and everything is new. Blessed to be the first occupant of this room. Very huge windows, good view of the opposite side of apartment. I can draw money easily from the ATMs and snacks/drinks from 7/11 easily. Varitieties of food at budget friendly prices at the huge tiong bahru market food centre. it's impressive. pockets of hip cafes and old shops in this quaint neighbourhood. Nice feeling overall."
"It__ a 10 min walk from the MRT but if you know how to take the bus, it__ located right outside the compound.  Overall good value and clean room with AC."
"Clean, private and Stylish space ! Awesome location with tonnes of local delights and convenience to travel to town within 20mins. Would definitely be back ;)"
Highly recommended!!
"The room was really warm maybe because the ac needs cleaning. Nevertheless, Darrick was accommodating. His staff were also really patient and kind."
"If you are looking for a relaxing place to stay in Singapore, then I would suggest this place.  The room was clean but the toilet was downstairs. The kitchen and washer are in common areas. 
To add, the caretaker of the building was not very helpful."
"This place is very comfortable and convenience residence, nearly the orchard area and land mark shipping malls. The room is clean and modern and Mr. Darrick is very great host. This is one of the best choice to stay at Singapore."

"Clean bathroom, comfortable bed, very close to a bus stop"
Everything that has been mentioned is provided at this place. It is super comfortable and nice place.
"Location was about 10 minutes walk to the closest train station. Room was spacious, but watch out for the slanted roof. It's a bit of an odd layout where you enter the door and the washroom is located next to the entrance. There is a narrow flight of stairs from the doorway to the bedroom which separates the washroom from the bedroom. Host was quick with responses even at late hours. Really appreciated it."
"Good location. Near Orchard, near Clarke quay. Near Chinatown. No-frills room. Just the basic amenities. Strong wifi connection, cold AC, huge Smart TV. Next to the bus stop."
Nice place to stay

A good place to stay within walking distance of the river and all that that entails
Sir Darrick's place is very clean and comfy to stay. Thank you so much for being so accommodating to our requests also. :)
"It was nice to stay, near to bus station and MRT, also not too far from orchard road"
"really recommended place for stayed with friends or family..
the room is spacious, easy to order taxi, and strategies location"
"The place was nice-accomodated, sparkling clean and 5-min-walk kind of close to Somerset MRT, at which you could basically get to anywhere in Singapore from there. Though RC and his assistant replied a bit slow, I__ happy about my stay and would love to recommend it to my fellow friends travelling to Singapore."
"My stay at RC's place was better than expected. The room seemed a little smaller in the pictures but was bigger irl, plus it is near the bus station so its easier to go anywhere"
Not bad.. can come to stay for a short trip
Good value for good location
"Near downtown, and easy access"
"Dieses Haus verfÃ¼gt Ã¼ber 8 bis 10 Zimmer. Jedes wird einzel vermietet. Ich habe gemeint in einer Wohnung ein Zimmer zu mieten. Man hat seinen eigen Raum zum abschliess und ein Privates sauberes Bad. Die anderen Dinge, Herdplatte oder Wasserspender im Gang auf engem Raum zum Teilen. Gute Gegend mit Bus Station und Metro, 10 zu Fuss. Klein, Sauber fÃ¼r City / Shoppingtripp ohne grosse WÃ¼nsche. Schlafen Duschen und Singapore geniessen. KÃ¼hl und Sauber. Gerne."
Nice place to stay and about 10mins walk to Somerset mrt station. There__ mall and FairPrice market nearby!
"Place is clean and location is very strategic about 10 mins away from Orchard Road, decent little cafes nearby as well. Only thing to take note is the toilet and bedroom area is separated by a flight of stairs (i.e. climb down a flight of stairs to get to the toilet) which can be inconvenient in the middle of the night"
"The room consists of 2 floors: bathroom at the first floor, while bedroom is upstairs. The bedroom is quite spacious. There is no coffee/tea, but there's water dispenser outside the room. The shower water flow is slightly slow, but it is still fine. Location is central, so quite nice to walk around. Overall, it was a pleasant stay."
Great location. Easily to find. You can walk to Orchard Gateway. Definitely will come back soon at Rc__ place.
Good location and easy to find. Near bus stop. You can walk to the orchard. We had wonderful time in SG. Definitely coming back in Rc__ place soon. Thank you.
We had so much fun staying at this place. The bed was comfy and clean. The shower and aircon works perfectly fine during our stay. The location is great and near to the transportation and the grocery and food places. We love the area. Thank you. Happy stay. 
"Overall the room was clean.
Staf was friendly and nice.
Minus from me : the location not enough good. Because too far from MRT.
It__ suitable for family and baby.
The building was so nice and modern. Much more i expexted."
Great Place!
"Clean, and quite place."
The place was as described. It was roomy enough for a family of five with three kids. Beds were comfy. The location was very convenient to get around town as it__ close to Bus and metro station. Area felt safe walking around late at night. The price was also great for pricy Singapore :)
"Is quite good place, good location, close to mrt and bus with good eating options.
But there is a narrow stair to get to the sleeping area and the bathroom dawnstairs"
"Average,and a bit too Low for the celling."
"Great Location, Great staff. Much better value than hotels nearby the location"
Nice place to stay with

.
Great place to stay at.  850M from somerset MRT station. but there is also a bus stop near the place 50M away.  Overall it was a great experience staying at Darrick's place. His staff were very nice and promptly reply to our request and inquires.
"Overall if you are looking for a hostel experience at non hostel prices go for it.
I stayed in three rooms one was good the last close to a Nordic prison cell.
I would avoid as there is much better value out there and place was not clean"
"overall we had a good time at the apartment. it is very well located and you can reach it easy by taxi or metro. the bed and the couch weren't really comfortable. fortunately airconditioning was provided. we didn't use the kitchen, but the refrigerator was huge. easy check-in and check-out. we would stay again in this condo and recommend it to people who are looking for a low budget but modern apartment."
Very good location and stay!
Good location. Not as clean or modern as photos look.
"Photos didn't match the actual living space.. the room is much smaller than what is shown, however, the location was decent and communication was great."
Good location just room not as expected.
Super clean and stylish place to stay. Highly recommended host and place. Thumbs up
Place is in a good location. Supermarket nearby and also near to orchard central. Although place was kinda small its really cozy.
"Very good place to stay, well located, clean, safe, perfect communication with Kaurus.
Walking distance to the MRT station.
100% recommended ."
"Clean and cosy, good place to stay for a trip! Metros are near within 5-6mins walk, convenient to everywhere. The family is nice and sweet, surely recommend"
"Wonderful family apartment. Wonderful family.
Easy to do my own thing but also some really pleasant interactions with the hosts too.
Well connected to city via public transport.
Good hawkers within walking distance.
Highly recommended."
"Best hospitality I ever experienced! Very clean, bright and modern accommodation, comfortable bed, delicious organic breakfast, clean bathroom, convenient apartment location! Thank you so much for incredible hospitality!!! Very recommended!"
"Being brand new, expectations of new things are met, no issues at all, Joey was helpful and so is the cleaner. We don't really see them since they don't live there, but it's self checkin in general and everything was easy to use. Location splendid, walkable to two MRT and a peaceful enclave amidst the chirpy neighbourhood. Mix of expats and locals, the tiong bahru market here sums up all kinds of interesting folks and families. Not to mention the yummy food. Checkout was easy too, self checkout. :)"
The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
"Apartment was as expected - great location and very tidy, but it does get a bit noisy in the evenings with Little Creatures Brewery directly downstairs. The bar closes by about midnight so as long as you can deal with that, the stay is excellent.

Make sure your Mobile contact details in AirBnB are updated, as the host and apartment operators contact you via Whats App instead of through the AirBnB app. If you don't respond, they assume you are in agreement, so it's best to make sure your details are updated to avoid any communication issues like we had."
ok
"Outstanding location, clean, well furnished apartment. Not big, but comfortable for a family of four. Could add curtains to avoid the morning light through the glass windows."
Very nice place!!
The host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
Nice convenient location with lots of restaurants and bars around. Can be a little noisy at midnight from all the actions on the street!
"This property is walking distance to chinatown and telok ayer mrt. Approximately 10 min to marina and 15 min to sentosa by taxi . Very good location. Near with some retaurant and food street. The apartment was clean&tidy. And big enough. At the weekend it was very crowded until late night, and at the wee kdays it was very nice&quite. 

But overall its very recomended

Tips: Please bring your own soap&shampoo."
Apartment located within walking distance of attractions and eateries.
"Great place! Walking distance to a lot of restaurants, China Town, and transportation. Also, the staff are so nice and will help with anything assistance needed:)"
Good location! __±´_ 2ê°___ _____.
"Great location close to many hawker centres, eateries and nightlife. As pictured. Easy check in and good communication from host."
We had a great stay! Always like to stay here when I__ in Singapore. Hope to stay again someday soon.
Perfect location. Smooth check in and check out. Great facilities. Brigde to Paragon.
Great accommodation in the best area in Singapore. The apartment is bigger than expected and the amenities of the property is beyond amazing. Will definitely come back again
"Superb location, near everything, comfortable space."
"Excellent host , Great communication and smooth check in , Will recommend"
This place nice and clean. The owner really helpful. This place exactly on the Tiong Bahru road.
"Stay there for 14days, Jing was nice and friendly, enjoyed stay there."
Mia is super kind and the place is just so nice. Super private and convenient!
This place is perfect for the ones who are looking for clean place in Singapore and also for the ones who are looking for the place that makes you feel like staying at home. Host is very kind and gives you a very quick response if you have any problems or if you ask for anything else. I would love to stay here once again if I go to Singapore.
Mia is a communicative and friendly host with a comfortable apartment. Thank you!
Everything is great!
"Wonderful place for me. public transformation is very comfortable. East coast is one of the most place for walking, going to bicycle, and so on. Room and kitchen is very clean and comfortable. I prepared for my dinner at home every day.
Mia must be a great super host. She respond rapidly. If I go to Singapore Again, I'll reserve again. I strictly recommend this Airbnb house for you~!"
The room is exactly the same as shown in the photos. It was so convinient to my workplace and also bus stop is just next to the unique apartment which just 5 min ride to MRT station and famous Old Airport Rd Food Court. And it's so close to East Coast Park if you like to exercise. And the host Mia is superb in accommodating my extra requests. Recommend to all.
"Mia's place is wonderful. It is close to the beach so it was lovely to be able to jog around the area and take a breather from work. The living space is airy and bright, with lots of natural light. With any stay, communication is key. Mia communicated very well with me. Any issues (e.g., laundry stuff) get resolved in a matter of minutes to a few hours. Finally, Mia is a great, fun and ambitious individual. Great vibes all around. You would love staying at her place, 100%."
Nice place
"I have stayed at Christine__ places before on Club Street, and this time I enjoyed my stay even more. Check-in was timely and easy; check-out was a breeze. Communication was always good.

The listing was sufficiently spacious for my use, and I think it would be spacious enough with two guests. Everything worked, and all of the equipment functioned well. There was plenty of water pressure and hot water for showers and cleaning.

The HDMI cable provided will allow you to stream entertainment from your laptop to the TV set. This was greatly appreciated. I found the bed to be very comfortable, and the air-conditioning worked well. The pedestal fan in the unit came in very handy. The washer/dryer also worked well.

The location is superb. If you like to try out Singapore__ restaurants, bars, and other night life, you could not get a better location. This is the district where you want to be, tucked between Chinatown and the CBD. It is fun, but safe.

On Friday and Saturday nights, you will occasionally hear partying out on the street or in the bar down below, into the late hours. It did not bother me, but you should be aware of it. Many working professionals come into this area for happy hour, and on Fridays and Saturdays, the partying often goes on pretty late. So if you like that scene, this is your place. If I needed to drown out the noise, I just turned on the pedestal fan.

There is a convenience store just steps away from the entrance to the building; plenty of restaurants nearby. There is a hawker center only about five minutes away. And there is a large indoor shopping mall that has a grocery store which is only about five minutes away, walking in a different direction.

I hope to stay here again the next time I__ in Singapore."
Thanks for the stay! Great location and has everything you__ need! Clean and spacious and well suited for two people. I would recommend this place to my friends.

"Chinatown is a great place to stay in Singapore! There are a huge hawkers; Maxwell Food Centre, convenient store, cute restaurants, bars, and souvenir shops. This place was clean and tidy. Recommended :)"
"Wonderful apartment in a great location. I stayed Friday and Saturday night. Club street was loud and fun. But once I closed the door, I couldn__ hear a thing."
Everything was great. The location close to the MRT and bars and restaurants are in the same street.

Really good location. Surprisingly quiet given it's proximity to the street which really comes alive on Friday night. Basic and functional but good value for money and so central for the river and Chinatown.
Great location!!! Close to bars and restaurants and in the heart of China Town. Hawker halls not far either - great for a quick cheap breakfast. All made for a great local experience. Air conditioning was amazing and much needed in the city. It had everything we needed for our 3 night stay. Our apartment was at the front and we hardly heard any noise from the weekend crowd.
Beautiful and spacious apartment in a very convenient location. So happy for the full size refrigerator and washer/dryer. Had a very comfortable stay and would highly recommend it to others.
The place is exactly as described. We had a great time in Singapore staying at Christine's place!
Great location.
I recommend this apartment.
Stay was wonderful but there was no personal host interaction... Location was very good at the heart of Chinatown and every attraction was nearby via bus or MRT... Chinatown MRT is just 3-4 mins walk from Chinatown MRT exit C... Will recommend for couple travellers to stay... Kitchenette was good with almost all amenities to cook small meals... Apartment had a washer with detergent available... Washroom had hot and cold water available alongwith the bodywash and shampoo... Overall a nice place to stay during a short trip to Singapore... Fairprice and few supermarts are on the way to Chinatown MRT exit D...
Christine__ place was really nice. The place was very clean and the location was great. Would definitely recommend!
"Place was good, clean and easy to access"
We stayed in Christine's place for several days during our visit to Singapore. The location was much more strategic than we thought. It was really close walking distance to Chinatown MRT station and a bit further walking distance to Bayfront MRT station (close to the hawker area where they shot Crazy Rich Asians). The walks to these stations were also nice. Lots of hip bars and brunch places! The place's amenities were also great. We managed to do laundry with the machine + dryer and the detergent was provided for us! Would return anytime we go back to Singapore.
"The apartment was great. Easy check, quite clean, small but well laid out, and an interesting neighborhood with amazing coffee just across the street."
Great location & accurate description
"It's a very basic but comfortable apartment with base necessities. Great shower. For our time in Singapore is was a prime location near many transportation lines. Perfect size for a couple and a safe, secure building. We would definitely stay here again. Good instructions."
L'alloggio Ã¨ esattamente come nelle foto. Siamo rimasti due giorni e ci siamo trovati molto bene. Il quartiere Ã¨ molto comodo ed Ã¨ semplice muoversi per visitare la citt_.
"When it comes to accommodations, location, and value, this is a great place. Check in was instant. Many thanks to Jean for follow up assistance throughout my stay. The unit was very clean and the staff are very polite and helpful. I stayed for over a week and had zero issues. Really like the big windows. Internet is very fast and AC is very efficient. I used the the kitchen daily. There isn't a microwave or an iron but I didn't need either one so it wasn't an issue. I've read that the surrounding area can be noisy sometimes in the evenings, but since I was staying during a semi lockdown due to Covid-19 and most of the establishments were closed so it was very quiet. The unit has double pane windows so I would think most of the sound outside would be blocked. Overall I had a great stay and highly recommend this unit or others in the building. I will stay again."
Very nice place.
Great place !!
Nice and cozy places for 2 pax. You can find everything you need in this apartment. The place is easy to locate and mrt is just nearby. Easy check in/out procedures. Only small problem is the AC is slightly noisy.
Great!
Worth the stay !!
Great location and very good sound proof window for the noise from outside but no blackout curtain. Clean and all work well.
Very nice place! Great hospitality! Will come back!
"Wonderful stay, room for 5-6, close to great food, would stay again!!"
"Thanks for sharing your space with our family- there was plenty of room for five and it was lovely- cool and clean!
We loved the architecture of the area, found great food at the markets, coffee at the bakeries and a book shop that was fantastic- it was a quick stop for us but we loved our time and were glad we picked the area and the home!
Communication was easy and fast. Thanks again for having us."

can't beat the location--conveniently close to all the hustle and bustle whilst still quiet and residential
"Die Lage kÃ¶nnte nicht besser sein, das Apartment ist mit KÃ¼che und zwei BÃ¤dern gut ausgestattet und im Zimmer gibt's auch auf kleinem Raum Schreibtisch und Kleiderschrank. Einzig das zu kleine und unbequeme Bett trÃ¼bt die Freude gerade bei lÃ¤ngeren Aufenthalten. Wer aber unter 1,80m gro_ und entsprechend leicht ist, dÃ¼rfte damit keine Probleme haben. Und mit dem Preis-LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnis kommt bestimmt jeder klar.
Darum Daumen hoch! Klare Empfehlung!"
"Centrally located. Close to amenities and public transport. Comfortable bed and a good quality A/C unit (essential for Singapore). 

Overall, abit noisy at night. Noise coming from passing traffic, restaurants below and other tenants in the AirBnB. 

Hillary was easy to communicate with and timely with every request."
Anup is very reactive and friendly. The location was perfect for my trip. I recommend.
Very nice place
"Good location, adequate for a short stay and cheap option. Nothing fancy, just adequate. easy access"
"Very kind family.

It was nice traveling."

"I felt welcome straight away at Anup's apartment. Unfortunately, I never did meet Anup due to his work timings, but his wife was very warm and friendly, and made sure I was comfortable. (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps dropped me 10 mins away from the place but Anup promptly helped guide me correctly and I did not have any trouble checking in.
The one thing I found negative is that the surrounding area was a bit noisy at night. Not a problem if you are a deep sleeper or don't have a very early start.

Overall, good value for money."
Good place to rent.
"I made a mistake of my hotel booking and had to find a place to stay for one night in a last minute. Fortunately I found Anup__ place at a very low price that is available and the past reviews seem not bad. So I tried.

Anup is helpful and fast in responding.

However, I didn__ have a good experience in the place. When I arrived, I realised that it is actually an industrial area and the flat is in the public housing estate. 

I didn__ sleep well the whole night because the mattress, bed sheet, pillows and blanket smell badly and it__ like different people slept there before and were not washed. The room is old and dark. From day to night time, I can hear the noises of cars outside. I woke up at 4am and couldn__ sleep since then, plus the bed smell.

Anup and his wife are nice and Anup is helpful. No offence. I hope that can be a good feedback to Anup and others. Hope they can prepare well for next guests. 

It is a low budget place, probably my expectation has to be lower."

Quite noisy for the whole day. Other than that is fine.
"the location of the Airbnb is very convenient, however, there are no closed windows in the room and the area is very busy and loud."
"Way better than what I was expected.
So nice people. Feel like home."
Very nice and friendly hosts.
I was surprised with the little thoughts inside the room. coffee and water. Anup was very well accommodating. I wish to come back again in near future. Highly recommended to others.
"It's in a good location with lots of food markets nearby and convenience stores downstairs. The transportation is also very convenient. The bus stop is just downstairs. The landlord will reply to me as soon as possible even though he is at work. His family are very kind. Not only did I have the change-over plug ready, but I also had my thermos filled with water ahead of time. They also have a very lovely child. I love their beds. They're comfortable."

A very hospitable host! 10/10!
The price was quite good considering the high costs of the hotel. It is also centrally located and easy to use public transport. The sound of cars passing by is not very comfortable at nights.
Strategic location...
"Good value, good people and amazing food close by."
Nice and tidy...
Very Accommodating and reach my expectations
Great host
Good place. Close to all public services.
"The place is great, with adequate amenities in the room. Anup and his family members are very friendly. There are a lot of eateries around, places for quick shopping , good connectivity as the bus stop is just downstairs. We had a very comfortable stay. Surely wish to come back :) !!!"
Our hosts were very friendly and the place was sparkling clean. We found the directions to the house to be fairly straightforward as well.
"Anup's place is well connected to every major tourist destination in the country, courtesy the bus stand right outside the block. The room is as clean as the well maintained, albeit a bit compact, washroom and toilet.
Our last night (Saturday) was terribly noisy on the street outside- somehow- but on the preceding two, we slept quite comfortably.
The host and his family are quite hospitable, friendly and nice people."

Mr.J's house was a very clean and comfortable stay. You can walk to the MRT station in about 3 minutes on foot from the bus stop. The security is very good and there are 7-Eleven and restaurants nearby.

Also all of the restaurants close by are tasty. 

We used mostly MRT to commute (turn left from the pool gate and walk about 10 minutes to Boon Keng station)."

overall it's not really bad compared to the other apartment I've been staying in Singapore"
Stayed at Mr. J apartment for six days . Clean apartment. Nicely located with MRT and bus stops close by . Made our commute easy . Quick response by Mr. J and team . Had a good stay .
"It was the first time I brought my family to Singapore and they are very happy with your place. The host was very nice and helpful. The apartment is clean and provides sufficient space for us with very helpful utensils, such as the washing machine and rice cooker, also the refrigerator and microwave. 

The pool is clean and convenience to be used.

We also love the neighbourhood, although took around 20-30 minutes walking from the nearest MRT station. The free parking lot really helped a lot. Definitely will take this place into consideration in our next visit to SG."

"Great host, Mr J is very communicative & fast in his responses. Instructions are clear given & generous in giving ammenities. Space is very well maintained & quality of the furnitures are up to standard. Kitchen & house cleaning tools are simple yet very usable! Very kid__ friendly, theres a small playground park in front & small pool in the facilities, just that during this covid19 we are unable to use it. 

We love the location of this apartment & how complete the apartment is with its furnishings touch. Location is near to Boon Keng MRT, local eateries, market & hawker food __pp. 10mins walk. Bus stop is 3mins walk, very convenient to travel around with (Hidden by Airbnb) app. Furthermore, right across (on the right side) from the carpark area (walk from front access), its just 3mins walk to nearby small hawker food & mini markets if you need urgent groceries. 7-11 is right at the back about 3mins walk (walk from the pool access). 

Asides from that, we love staying here, its very airy & quiet & convenient! Would definitely come back! Love how homey this apartment is!"
Nice comfortable place close to Little India. There are few shops at walking distance (including 7-11) to buy basic items. Overall good place to stay.

"Clean and convenient! Great communication and helpful. Apartment was  mainly used after long day of touring and eating around Singapore to have a place to cool down, relax , shower and sleep.

Nice place
Very nice and clean place. Everything looks nice as the pictures. We have a baby and he__ very happy with the place as well.
Place is very neat and comfortable. Near to SMRT bus stops. Well connected to the City.
"Great apartment in a quiet location, very close to food and shops.  Easy checkin and great hosts, apartment was clean and modern.  I used it for business travel but would suit a couple with a couple of kids also."
Great place to stay in singapore. Quiet neighbourhood and close to attractions
"Wonderful experience for staying at the (Website hidden by Airbnb) place is very clear& comfortable,you will feel just like your home. All you need is well maintained.Near the station & easy to find the building! The host communicated with me without any problem. I am highly recommend!!"
"Overall great stay at Mr. J's place. I appreciated the easy communication, cleanliness, comfortable bedding and checkin process! Internet connection in bedrooms and 2nd bedroom sink pressure could be stronger"
"He__ really a superhost. Super kind and helpful. I don__ usually give reviews but he deserves it. Very nice place, peaceful and quiet neigborhood. Near to atm machines, convenience stores, restaurants and many more."
Graet Host
Thanks for a pleasant stay! Only issue I had was that the WiFi connection was poor in the rooms. But Mr J was always very prompt in responding and I really appreciate that. Thanks again!
Clean place. Nearby park and restaurant. Reliable host.
"Fast response from host Mr.J , high cleanliness standard and quiet neighbourhood."

"Very nice and clean apartment! The best choice for 6 travelers! It__ a beautiful 5 floor building, clean and quite! I also like the neighborhood very much with a well designed playground in front of the building! There is also a swimming pool for the building! It__ 3 minutes walk to a mini food  court for meals!"
Very nice place to stay! Little walk to bus stops/train station and restaurants close by. Host was very quick to respond to any enquiries.
"The J__ place is very homey and nice place . All family member dont want to go outside . Order food and can warm up in the house . 
Other thing is the view around the place also nice , going outside by walk to reach the MRT boon keng station or just side seeing around the area . U can find local food . 
So my family will stay again in J__ place if we are going to spore"
"Booked one month and was second time stay. it is nice location as bus convince, 5-10 minutes walk to MRT, best chicken rice wendong near also. I will book next time again"
"Mr J's apartment is near Boon Keng MRT, and right next to Bendemeer Primary.
We had a 4 year old with us so the best feature was that it's located on a quiet street with a park and playground directly opposite the property.
There is a pool as well that was useful. 

Recommended for people staying with young kids at an affordable price"
"Nice location, many nice restaurants nearby."
"Very lovely place to stay, very clean and in a quiet location with easy access to the MRT. 

Would happily stay here again."
"You guys definitely have to try this place to stay in SG. Great ambiance, location, and everything "
"Me and my family really enjoyed staying at Mr. J__ apartment. The place has a stylish feel, looks exactly like in the pictures. Mr. J was quick in responding to queries. Besides, he was accommodating to provide extra bed sheets, pillows and hand soap. Would love to return staying in the future."
"A small apartment block in a very quiet road off Serangoon Road. Ideal for the MRT and local shops/cafes.

The host is kind and efficient and responds quickly to any questions.

The apartment itself is clean and well maintained with excellent security features. All the basics are there, although the lack of additional frills means that the kitchen cupboards are quite bare. Some people may prefer firmer pillows.

Sound insulation in the building is poor. You are aware of the movement of people around you and every time the lift is used the bell is clearly heard.

On balance though a perfectly fine base for a few days in Singapore and one that we would happily use again."
.
"The house is very clean and we have a comfortable stay. Given that the house is not on the  main road, hence we able to enjoy the quiet serenity of the house.  

Also, Mr J is very helpful and quick to response to all my enquiries. 

The only minor feedback, is the location to the MRT. It is still within walking distance to the nearest station. But it will need at least 10mins of walking there."
Clean place near to MRT and Bus stops. Convienent checkin and checkout.
"This place is great to stay. Very clean, great communication, everything you need. Not far from MRT station that has great hawker stands."
"Mr J's apartment is very well maintained and clean. he is always approachable on airbnb chat. The apartment itself has all the amenities that you may need. the TV even has Netflix subscription. apartment is close to MRT, restaurants, bakery, bus stops and next to a school. I would be very happy to suggest this place to my friends."
"Beautiful place, amazing host, everything you need for a perfect home."
"Mr.J is very friendly host .
We stayed there for 5 days...we wish to continue in the same place in our upcoming visits also.
Its very clean,new apartment, near to mrt,friendly kitchen ,neat bed...a very clean pool too.
My kids really liked the place."

Nice place and kind host
Thank you for great stay. Everything is basic but more than enough for us. Love that you have plug converters and Netflix is great addition.

"The apartment was nice and clean. We had a bit of a trouble getting the front door lock to work. Mr J came over to give us keys the next day. Some of the appliances would be nice to have instructions next it. The stove and shower is not as intuitive to operate. 

The MRT is about 7 min walk from the house, can be a bit difficult under the Singapore weather. The hawker stands at boon keng station is a must visit. We ate there almost everyday!

Overall, our visit to Singapore is thumbs up!"
"Appartamento perfetto per due coppie, due camere con il loro bagno ensuite, pulitissimo e con tutto il necessario almeno per la colazione e il pranzo d__sporto!
Ci siamo trovati benissimo e l__ost ha sempre risposto alle nostre domande in meno di un minuto!
Lo consiglierÃ³ a chi deve partire per Singapore!"
"Mr. J response very fast, and the home has everything you need specially for my case which I have a toddler and an infant. We were provided with a Baby cot, cooking utensils and all things we need that we didn't ask for. Very convenient also because it is near the center of Singapore which everything is accessible."

"Mr. J's condo was exactly as described and a wonderful retreat for us while visiting Singapore.  The apartment was very clean and welcoming, and only a short Grab ride away to downtown and the marina.  There was also a nice little playground right outside which the kids enjoyed while we were waiting for our rides."
"Mr J has been a good host communicating about the place in a timely manner. The place is bit smaller compared to the photos posted. Netflix provided in TV was a plus. Internet speed was very fast. Thanks for providing universal adapters and multi plug. This helps travellers from other countries.
Place is conveniently accessible from MRT and taxis."
It was great stay. The host reapobded to the request super quick and flexible.
"He has been a wonderful host, very flexible , we had late night flights he allowed us to keep our luggages in his place passed the check-out time, the place is quiet, clean and near lot of stuff.. it has been a pleasure Stay. _¥ï_
I would strongly recommend his place"

"Mr. J's place is located in the heartland of Singapore. There are a lot of nearby amenities. The famous Boon Tong Kee chicken rice is a must try for foodies! 
Wonderful place to stay! I must say that the rain shower head in both bathrooms was a nice surprise. The apartment was clean and a quiet place to rest. I had a great time at Mr. J's place."

"We absolutely loved our stay in Singapore. The self-entry allowed us to arrive as soon as our flight landed and the space was so stylish and well laid out! A very thoughtful touch was the addition of a power cord and some Singapore adapter plugs, which came in use even when we had our own! 

It may be smart to travel with a small mirror or add one to the bathroom/bedrooms as there are no outlets in the bathroom to use a mirror for hair styling, but that was our only real worry. The addition of hand towels may be nice as well, but we loved the towels that were provided! The beds were awesome and the location was spot on. It__ about a 10 minute walk to Boon Kent station and it ends up being very simple to navigate town from the stop or with a Grab hire, which is a great, inexpensive way to explore by car! Thank you so much for the stay - if we come to Singapore again we will be back!"
"The apartment was very safe, clean, neat, convenient, it was included almost all tools, small appliances, cooking materials that the traveller would expect or even exceed the expectations, my family stayed a wonderful holiday there and they were very satisfied.
This was my first time booking the room in ABNB and I was so grateful to deal with Mr. J., You always speedy responses, adapted my special needs, very thoughtful and warm hearted. Thank you Mr.J.! I will definitely recommend your apartment to my friends."

The apartment__ about a 10-min walk to Boon Keng station but taking a cab to center city is also cheap. The space is clean and everything worked! The only problem we had was the wifi didn__ work in one of the rooms but definitely worked in the living room/kitchen area. Overall, it was a great stay and would gladly stay again!"
"It is located in a quiet area surrounded by private properties. Great option for family! Clean, tidy and well- furnished. There is a kitchen, small but well- equipped. It__ very convenient for preparing quick breakfast. And there are two restrooms which is convenient for families. 
Mr.J is kind and helpful. It__ easy to reach to him and sink for support. He always answers promptly."
"It is located 15 minutes away from the station, and it was good because it was able to reach tourist attractions easily by public transportation. Everything was inside, and the swimming pool was good. I made good memories in Singapore."
"Mr. J__ place is like described  in the listing. The neighborhood is very quiet. In 10 minutes walk you can reach MRT Boon Keng station, a food center (morning till evening) that you can try lots of local delicacy from and a small market supplying fresh fruits and household stuffs, One thing that the toilet in one of the bathroom is leaking so we didn__ use that one at all during our stay. Anyhow, it__ a good place to stay if you are traveling with family."

"Well maintained ,clean condo and close to the MRT. Mr J was exceptional with communication with response time less than 30 minutes and was very accommodative to our requests.
The condo__ locations is close to the bus stop, and 10 mins walk from the MRT. All attractions are within 15 to 20 mins on the MRT and is 20 mins  by cab from Changi airport."
"Quite place, freshair, suitable for relax"
"Mr J was a great host in his quick responses to my enquiries and providing such a great place to stay. The place was modern, simple, clean and located in a quiet neighbourhood which made the stay a very cozy and comfortable one.

There is also a good variety of public buses that reach the bus stops nearby, and these buses could take one all the way to town and different parts of Singapore. Definitely a convenient, comfortable and valued-for-money place to stay in! Highly recommended!"
"We stayed here for almost 2 months. The property wasn't accurate. When we arrived, the entire place smelled like cigarettes and the floors were dirty. The host wouldn't do anything about it and wouldn't even offer a discount for the inconvenience. Wifi wasn't great either and was spotty. It took a few weeks of complaining to the host to finally send someone over to fix the wifi. Overall, the host didn't provide a great service to us even though we were long term tenants."
A great location to stay at. 5 mins walk to Boon Keng station. A quiet and beautiful neighbourhood. Completely enjoyed our stay. Mr J is very responsive and very hospitable!
"We had a great time at J's apartment. Brand new tastefully designed with basic amenities all provided. My children love the pool! It also minute walk to train station, bus stop, cafes, eateries and bar. We had a great stay, very convenient if you want to explore Singapore! Worth it!"
"Gorgeous place, and really new! Check in was fuss free, and the place was spotless. The location is amazing. The host was helpful and really prompt in his responses. Will definitely recommend!"

There is an Electric Iron and table. Universal  adopters for plugs are made available . Few utensils, mugs, plates, Microoven, Induction Heater and water heater jug are available. There was no coffe or tea pockets for immediate use. Please carry them if you want or buy . Things are much costlier in Singapore , especially travellers from India will feel the pinch.

The stay was generally comfortable.

Good host and good communication it__ good for family or two couples. The only thing we had some problems with the door locker but that__ the only problem we had and they solve it efficiently.
"Excellent apartment, true to the pictures. J. is great in communication. Accommodated our early check-in and late check-out. Thank you for the great experience!"
"Mr. J's place was perfect for our short-term (4 nights) stay in Singapore. There was 7/11 and a 24-hour restaurant couple of minutes away. And the Boon Heng MRT was about 7 minutes walk. Mr. J was very responsive and came in person to help with our check-in and luggages.

Few thoughtful amenities (i.e. more or bigger floor rugs in the bathroom/kitchen, hand soap/towel hangers/shelves in bathroom, tea/coffee/sugar in the kitchen, etc.) would make this even better place to stay."
very comfortable place

Kitchen with provided microwave, kettle and all kitchenettes. We were scared of the virus so we used the laundry machine for couple times. Mr.J apartment was very convenient. It has 7-11 just across the street. Fresh market or food market just 600m walk to Boon Keng mrt. Famous Dim Sum restaurant just behind the building.
My daughter forgot her backpack at the playgroud and Mr.J found it and willing to send it to Thailand for me. Overall was excellent! Would love to stay there again."

All the troubles that I could had  during this period regarding the apartment, he was more than keen to help and solve everything . The appartment is perfect for long stay , had all neccesary for living. Very cozy ."
good
Awesome
I highly recommend this unit. Nice and clean interiors
Very new homestay with small swimming pool and free parking. Nice environment! We have great time here with 3BR unit. Super deal! Highly recommend if holiday in Singapore.
The place was wonderfully clean and comfortable. And pretty. Loved the (Hidden by Airbnb) Chromecast.
"Good place, good location and homey atmosphere.
Recommend to stay."
"This place is truly great!!  We had a lovely family time and it felt like home. The place was spotless, very clean, and complete with amenities including the outlet adapters which other hosts fail to provide. The sheets and pillows were super soft and comfy! The location was great too, just a few minutes walk to MRT station and accessible to anywhere. It was definitely worth our money's worth and will surely recommend this place. :)"
"We had a very good experience under Mr. J__ hosting. He is always fast and warmly response, sharing the useful information, and helped us to find the best restaurant nearby. We enjoyed living here and would like to thank for his warmly hosting."

We ended up needing the hotel for longer than initially booked and we were quickly shifted to another apartment in the same building.  I went out to eat lunch and by the time I was back, all the suitcases, our food in the fridge and even the clothes drying on the clothing rack were transported to our new Airbnb! The AC is impeccable, high speed WiFi everywhere, and a smart TV as well as utensils and silverware in the kitchen made this an amazing and efficient stay."

Check in was easy and the premises are very secure. We enjoyed the use of the swimming pool and found that the amenities such as a washing machine/ dryer very useful.

"The apartment is in a new, secure block and in very good condition. Well-located around 10 minutes from MRT. Very clean and with good amenities. The pool is a nice extra. We were able to check in early and on the last day we left our luggage till 4 pm - that was very helpful. Just note that two of the three bedrooms are very small and only fit a double bed - in practice we had to keep our suitcases in the hallway or living area. I guess that for Singapore this is quite standard, but it could be an issue for some. Other than that, a good place that I would recommend."

"Hands down the best Airbnb stay I've had so far. The apartment was clean with fresh bedsheets when we arrived. The check-in process was really easy and hassle-free using a digital lock. It is located in a good area where we can easily reach Changi airport, Orchard road and other touristy places. Mr. J was also very thoughtful, there were extra pillows, plenty tissue rolls, iron, hairdryer, cooking and eating utensils perfect for a family trip! Keep up the good work!"
As expected
"This is a very good no fuss apartment - spotlessly clean, spacious, short 7-8 minute walk to MRT past local shops and everything you could need as a base to explore Singapore. It__ in a residential district but the MRT and Grab cabs are so good and cheap it takes no time to get downtown or anywhere else you need to go - just 2 MRT stops to Little India and Chinatown where the food is sensational.

Beds comfortable,  2 modern bathrooms with good showers. WiFi excellent and access to building and apartment via entry code system so zero hassle getting in and and out. Pool is small but great for a quick cool off after a long hot day out!

Mr J. and his team are super responsive to communications and requests - a great stay thanks!"
Very good

"A nice apartment from where you can reach every point in Singapore easily by MRT or bus. Enough place for up to six people to live comfortably, with more guests can get cramped. If we visit Singapore again we will consider to book the apartment again."
"Das Apartment wÃ¼rde ich fÃ¼r maximal vier Personen empfehlen. Die Ausstattung ist einfach und mit dem nÃ¶tigsten versehen. Die Lage war fÃ¼r uns sehr gut, in 10 Minuten ist man an der MRT Station Boon Keng. Somit kann man das U- Bahn Netz fÃ¼r diverse Erkundungen sehr gut nÃ¼tzen. Dieses funktioniert sicher und schnell."
"easily accessed. 
wifi worked well
clean and comfy
needs a few kitchen bits if were going to cook easily but you can manage and plenty nearby eating places/takeout.
washer dryer worked well.
small playground just outisde but a bigger one just round the corner
max 10mins to the mrt."
"A well appointed place that is quiet. Even for the unit that was facing the back alleys of the row of shophouses and the main road, the apartment was surprisingly quiet due to excellent noise insulation."
Convenient area. Public transport easy to travel around.

Hope to stay back soon!!!!"

Its very clean place and quite . I feel like home !
We loved our stay. It's a great place
"Overall satisfied, fast response from owner, rooms are big and clean. However, it would be better to have more child friendly facilities such as toilet plates, low stool... also, the heaters are not heat enough in both washrooms."
Nice location. Easy communication. Great experience to stay.
Mr. J__ apartment was very clean and tastefully decorated. Location is great - there__ a small playground nearby and places like Orchard are only a short taxi ride away.
Place was so clean and good family having a vacation. Able to provide our needs as per request. Pool not too big but have privacy. Peaceful and quiet. Easy access. Love to recommend.
There were a lot of nats in the house I think coming from drains in bathroom. That storage closet had a very bad odor and underneath sink. There were no paper towels or face towels. I think you should possibly list that so people know to bring them due to no shopping area that has them close by. The first bedroom to right walking down hallway bed was really hard. Overall good location and thanks for the converter plugs.

"The unit was clean, comfortable, and situated in a residential neighborhood within walking distance to the MRT, restaurants, and the Bendemeer Market. The host also has other Airbnb units in the same building. Good value for the money."
"We had a pleasant stay in Singapore thanks to Mr. J's hospitality and great little flat. A little out of the city center but very quiet at night, and a short walk to the MRT. Basic kitchen for preparing food and simple, stylish design. What stands out most is how quickly he responded to all our inquiries, was helpful and informative, always courteous and reliable. That is very refreshing on a long trip like ours, and my family were grateful for his help and advice."
the halal restaurant is nearby
5 stars for all aspects! Very near to bus stop & Boon Keng MRT. Don't trust (Hidden by Airbnb) maps too much. Hehehe. You need to walk more if you follow (Hidden by Airbnb) maps. The accommodation really nice!
convenient
"This place was awesome, I HIGHLY recommend you book it."
"Nice, clean and comfortable condo. One master bedroom with a restroom and two smaller rooms. Had a washer/dryer which was very convenient. About 5 minute walk from 7-11. Great selection of take out delivery using the Grab app. Remember to bring an adapter for the power outlets if you don't have one."
"A nice, spacious, well-equipped flat. Plenty of crockery and cutlery provided in the kitchen, very nicely and neatly arranged in the cupboard. Clean. Nice modern furniture, good beds and bedlinen. Ample amount of shampoo, shower gel and toilet paper provided - much appreciated. Location is good, close to MRT, local foodcourts and eateries. Communication with the host was good. Check-in information was clear. We liked the key-less electric lock. Sound isolation of the building is not too good. The only major issue is that the wifi was quite weak, even though there were more networks, it only really worked in the living room / kitchen - this should be improved."
"This is not my 1st time and will not be my last staying in Mr J's apartment. Mr J always very understanding and helpful on all requests.  he went way out of his way to ensure my stay have been well taken care of. 

Thank you so much and highly recommended if someone want to stay with the peace of mind."

"Really nice place to stay if you__e traveling with a big family. There__ ample privacy between the bedrooms, beds are really comfy, the whole place is very clean and functional. The shower__ lovely especially after a whole day of exploring. I love that the wifi__ very fast and there__ Netflix on the TV. My only concern was there__ a leak in the bidet so the master__ bedroom floor stayed wet, we just turned it off when we weren__ using it. The place is a 10 minute walk from the nearest MRT and 3 minute walk from the bus station. There are also restaurants and convenience stores nearby. The neighborhood where the apartment is located is really nice as well. It__ like a mini suburb in the heart of the city. Mr. J was also very considerate about letting us leave our luggages for safety so we didn__ have to lug the big things around prior to check in and check out. Highly recommend this place!! _"
"Mr. J's place is very clean and modern. It was a great stay for us in Singapore, about a 10-12 min. walk to MRT. We found the access to the buses to be far more convenient - there are a number of buses that go to the downtown core just a block or so away. Also lots of good neighborhood eats. Very local, non-touristy vibe to this place. Mr. J is also super communicative! He responded to each of our needs - just a heads up that if you are planning to use the sofa couch, you should let Mr. J know in advance so he can supply sheets."
Very nice place. A home miles away from home. Two thumbs up!

"The apartment is new, clean and tidy , well-equipped. The host is nice and fast response to my questions. I enjoy the stay"
The place is in the middle of city yet the neighbourhood atmosphere is quite and not crowded. Ideal place when you are staying with group of people in family. Highly recommended for family stay.
"The apartment is quite new, clean and located strategically near the main road, it can be accessed either from the front and back.

The 3 bedrooms can accommodate 6 people and the sofabed in front of the TV in the living room can be for 2 people.

There is a small swimming pool on the ground floor.."

"Apartment is sparling clean. I love to enjoy comfortable bed after whole day exploring city. There is also swimming pool to relax. 

It__ easy to access by front or back gate. It takes about 10 minutes to nearest MRT station (Boon Keng), but you can access nearby bus stops by 5 minute walking. 

The wifi connection is quite low. We just could use wifi in living room.

Host responsed quickly to your messages even at late evening. He also provided converter adapter to use your electric devices in Singapore.

Overall, if you wanna find a place to stay with reasonable price in Singapore, it__ good choice for you."
"This is a great little space! We used the apartment for 2 nights and it was exactly what we needed. Beautifully designed and sparkling clean. Very comfy beds too!! Location was ideal, down the road from the hustle and bustle of Haji Lane. Slightly smaller than we expected but it really was all we needed. Host also responded to every query immediately, super smooth and couldn't ask for more! Thank you Mr J!"
Everything is near perfect.  V high standard indeed for AirbnB..
Great stay! The place was exactly what we expected. Very clean and stylish and gave us exactly what we needed. The location is also great. It was easy to get everywhere we wanted to go.
"Very clean and comfortable apartment. It was smaller than expected, but the large couch, queen size beds, two bathrooms and storage room made it very comfortable for us 6 adults and 1 toddler. The MRT is a short walk away and easy to use, and the local food outlets are great. We definately recommend this apartment and Mr J who wad very helpful and fast with his responses to put queries."
"Very modern apartment, reasonably priced and clean. Great host who__ always very responsive"
"You can come and stay at Mr.J 's place, blindfolded. No need to read reviews, too."
"The apartment is very comfortable. It__ got everything we need. It surely made our stay in Singapore even more enjoyable. Something wrong with the keypad, Mr.J sent someone right away to let us in. We really appreciated it."
"Nice and comfortable place! Might be too tight for 9 people, perfect for 6. lock was faulty but the host responded quickly despite late hours."
Everything we needed before we even knew it had been provided in the unit. Our whole family enjoyed our stay. Sparkling clean!

"mr.J apartment is sparkling clean.  the  master bedroom is a good size, but the other 2 bedrooms are small, you need to unpack everything in your luggage, and put whatever you bring in the wardrobe, and put your luggage in the storage. 
Location is good. near bus stop, and MRT about 700 meter. 
Kitchen amenities are adequate."
The place is as amazing as all the reviews have mentioned. Very prompt response from the host and convenient location + access to apartment. 5 stars for the host!
"Thank you Mr. J for being a great host. The place is so peaceful & tidy. I love the kitchen utensils as i am very particular with that. One thing to recommend is mirror in each room since the 2 bedrooms have no mirror. But nonetheless, the place was great and there__ no hardship in checking in."
Thanks

It__ nice and tidy. Transportation is really convenient.
Everything is just the same as what's posted on the Airbnb. The apt is very clean and it's perfect that there's some cooking prep for us to make breakfast.  Mr J is also very nice to give help and respond quickly.  Highly recommended!

Located in Singapore suburb close to an MRT station. We really enjoyed our stay at Mr J's place.....
Great apartment with three seperate rooms and a great swimming pool on the ground floor.
The host is great and responsive to my enquiries. The place is quite comfy and stylish
"The house is presentably pleasant to stay in. Spacious unit and ample rooms to accomdate our family.  Location is convenient, walking distance to market, convenience shops, Boon Keng MRT station and accessibility to town. Mr J has been very prompt to resolving a few issues that I had raised during the stay and we feel at home in this house."
"Mr J is very responsive and accommodating. The location of the apartment is very convenient for the purpose of our trip, and close to MRT, bus stops, and local eateries. The apartment has everything we needed to stay comfortably, and it is clean too. Will definitely stay here again next time when we are in town."
"Mr J's places exceeded my family's expectation. The apartment was sparkling clean and very well equipped with anything you need to make your stay comfortable. The washer and dryer was a huge convenience!

The three bedrooms were all equipped with air conditioning as well as good quality duvet. Toilets were clean and hot water was never a problem.

Location wise it was very accessible with the MRT station 5 mins away. There's a convenience store just around the corner and several eateries including a famous cafe that is always crowded.

I highly recommend this apartment:)"
The unit is good got nice food around that area. 8m walk to train station
"Really nice apartment

Great stay !!
"Quaint apartment, just nice for 4-5 people. Good and secure too."
"The photos don't indicate how clean , and spacious the place really is. 

There's room for 6 people easily - you would not feel cramped.

Communication was great.

Parking is easy , there's food all within a couple of minutes walk, and the MRT is about 700m away. 

Will be back for sure

Mr. J__ place clean and and good house hold appliance. Suitable for visits with family. Close to bus station and mrt. Also close to where to eat 24 hours.
"Reservation was as expected and the place looks just like the pictures. Very clean and nice decor. Experience was very practical, no frills. All basic necessities were provided and we appreciated Mr J__ very quick responses. Our only complaint was the beds were kinda hard but that seems to be the norm in Singapore unless you__e at a super luxurious hotel. There__ a bus stop minutes away and train about 15 min walk however using the Grab App or Gojek was very cheap & convenient for us. They arrive within minutes and almost anyway is $5-$10. The area is residential and close to a school. Very safe & walkable but not a lot of main points around. There is a 7Eleven, smaller restaurants, and a small convenience store also nearby. Nice stay but we were excited to get to Bali for luxury & pampering while celebrating birthdays."
A great place to stay with ur family. I__ traveling with baby and Mr.J even providing a babycot as well. The place was clean and exactly like on the pictures. Will definitely recommend this place to our relatives when visiting Singapore in a future.
"This place is just like the pictures.
Apartment is clean, and has lift, so you don't have to take the stairs. 

We travelled with a baby, he also prepared babycod for us. 

Location is easy to find, check in is easy, no fuss. Food options are very limited. About 7-10 mins walk to the MRT station."
"Very good location,easy to transport,the apartment is cosy and clean,Mr J  has prepared everything we needed and answered our questions quickly. I definitely recommend it!"
"It was a very pleasant stay, very cooperative and helpful host"
"It was a comfortable apartment and gave us a sense of real life in Singapore, living amongst the locals and experiencing the markets and food stalls in the area. Air conditioning is great and the pool is handy. Fairly close to the MRT which is what we used every day to get around and there are some good restaurants and bars in the area (make sure you try the Harry Potter themed one!)"

"It was our first Air B2B outside of Australia. From an Australian family's standpoint, there were a few things we were not expecting.

Pros:
- Very responsive, flexible and helpful host
- Clean exterior pool for the building
- Close to convenient MRT station

Cons:
- Smaller than expected
- Small kitchen with bare minimum ustensiles, no oven. Hard to cook home meals
- Not the classiest neighbourhood
- Not the most comfortable/modern apartment"
All ok
"The unit is spacious, quiet, and very tidy. A nice pool is available downstairs, several restaurants and a bakery are just a minute walk away. Large hawker center, local shops and a MRT station are about 7  minutes walk. Mr. J was very helpful. I highly recommend this place. We stayed in three different AirBnB's during our Singapore trip and it was the nicest of the bunch. Great value as well."

Overall, we have a pleasant stay at J__. Will definitely stay at J__ place again if we__e coming back to Singapore."

Highly recommended and will definitely come back again!"
"Mr J place is beautiful and is really a home away from home. You have all the necessary items such as utensils, glasses, hairdryer and iron! It is a great place for groups of families and friends to stay together.

Good location. Quite roomy for our group of 7.  Only 10 minutes walk via back locked gate to the MRT. Restaurants nearby and there is a market style shopping area at the rear of the ground level at the MRT. There__ a nice pool for the complex next to the apartment. Mr J was most supportive in helping us to address an unexpected difficult experience during our stay.  He was very responsive at all times during our stay.
"The location was excellent, only a short walk to the closest MRT station which takes you everywhere in Singapore. The apartment had fantastic amenities and facilities and was spacious, clean and quiet. We had 5 adults and 3 young children and had plenty of room. The pool was excellent to use after a hot day of sightseeing and there were a couple of playgrounds close by for the kids to play. The communication was excellent and friendly. I would definately recommend this apartment for families. Thankyou to the host for such a lovely stay in Singapore!"
"We had a wonderful stay at Mr J's place in Singapore. It was great for our large family group of 5 adults and 5 children. The kids had lots of fun in the pool, and we enjoyed our daily visits to the markets at Boon Keng before we set of on our explorations by MRT each day. Mr J provided excellent communication and the apartment was clean and tidy and just as described."
Perfect for family... super love it _¤ï__¤ï__¤ï_
"The place is awesome, very clean, convenient, I love the environment! Don__ hesitate to book, definitely recommend!"
"Response, location everything is great. Rooms and the place looked bigger in pictures. If you have a child, it's very difficult to sleep in the same bed and rooms are pretty clumsy. I am not sure if it's the system in Singapore, but our place was not cleaned for the entire duration (6 days) of our stay. We were 6 adults and 2 kids, so it was difficult managing things without house getting cleaned. Of course cleaning was available by paying an additional amount."
The apartment was clean and spacious. Check in was really easy. Beds were comfortable and it was nice to have the swimming pool literally right next to the flat.
Great
Nice
"Amazing place. 
Friendly host.
Nice apartment.
Good experiences.
Nice swimming pool.
Convenient house.
Spacious."
Everything as described in the advertisement. The host provided us an early check-in which made our first day a better one. Communication was super fast and the host was very helpful. Location is great and there is a shortcut to the main road from the back side of the building. MRT is so close and there is a restaurant and a supermarket nearby which were open 24/7. Amenities are there for light cooking and two washing machines are available inside the apartment. We spent 4 days and our group was of 10 people including 3 children. We had a wonderful time there. Place was very clean and check-in and check-out was super easy.

"Second time staying there. Great place for staycation and gathering. Especially for the family from overseas. The apartment is very spacious, clean and comfortable. Can accommodate a big family and creating more bonding time rather than staying in a hotel which all of them will stay in their own hotel room. Definitely will come back again :) 

*Tips* The Teow Chew Porridge at the corner of the road is very delicious with reasonable price. "
"Mr.j is responsible host, I contacted him at midnight due to unsure functioning of the electronic stove but he still reply me with great manners and guide me slowly"
"This place is very nice, clean, and about a 7 min walk to the MRT. It worked great for our group."
"Mr J stepped in to let us stay at his apartment on very short 24 hour notice , he was great because his commas were very fast which took a lot of stress out of such a late booking
The place is very roomy with 4 bathrooms  & 4 bedrooms 2 with ensuite.
When entering through the front door you have a large lounge to the right with a kitchen with washing machine leading off to two bedrooms,  and two bathrooms, one attached as a ensuite to a bedroom, and to the left of the front door you have a large dining room also with a kitchen with washing machine and a large fridge freezer, that leads off to another 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, one of which is attached to a bedroom as ensuite, this lay out makes ideal for one very large family or perfect two family__ that want to share but still have there own bit of space.
Even though Mr J had very like time to prepare for arrival the whole place was spotlessly clean and was supplied with loads of soap, shampoo, washing up soap and washing machine detergent with hand wash soap at every basin 
As said on other reviews it__ a very short walk to a MRT station
One tip if you use the back gate when using the MRT station this will make a walk to the MRT even shorter
Mr J was a great host who I can highly recommend"
"my friends and i had a staycation at this place and we all loved it! at first we were worried that the place would be secluded, but it is very convenient as there are bus stops nearby and the mrt is within walking distance. the place is very spacious and everything we needed was provided. the wifi is great, the tv has youtube and netflix which kept us occupied most of the time we were there. there are many power sockets all around, the host even provided an extension cord and some plug adapters. overall, it was a great experience and the host was very responsive and nice as he allowed us to check out an hour later when requested. my friends and i really enjoyed the stay and would love to stay at this place again next time!"
"My husband and my kids stayed in Mr. J's apartment for 4 nights while I was in hospital for my back surgery. They loved the place! The apartment is located in a new building, it is very spacious and clean. Although it seems isolated, there are quite a bit of restaurants and stalls just a few minutes walk away. Would have stayed longer if the apartment was available. I would definitely recommend it!"
"The apartment is very spacious and had plenty of room for our family of four. The two-kitchen arrangement was odd but worked out. The location is a short walk to a grocery store or the metro, but it is not close to the Central Business District, which was fine for us. My biggest concern was that this is a ground-floor apartment and roughly half of the windows do not lock, and if they do, a little jiggling opens them right up. Hopefully this will be addressed. 
Mr. J was a great host and was always quick to reply when we were extending or asking questions."
Cozy
"J place is very cozy, sparkling clean and perfect amenities. J also easy to reach and fast response. He also very welcome with our questions regarding the house facilities. Absolutely will back again with my family! Thanks a lot J! I highly recommend his place for you guys!"

This beautiful private condo is near to 7eleven and other eateries, very convenient. We love the nearby dimsum restaurant (opens early evening till 2am)
There were 9 of us and the area is still very spacious for all of us. My sisters cooked breakfast daily (J thx for the toasters!). 
Place is super clean & looks brand new! We washed clothes daily as well. Since it was a humid the ACs really cool us off whenever we came back from a long outing. My nephews & nieces really enjoyed Netflix and high speed wifi. 
All the beds were so comfy and love the showers. 
We always use grab service so not sure about other public transports nearby. 
Will highly recommend especially families and big group."

Great communication from host although we didn__ meet them they were always quick to respond when we messaged.  They also let us store our bags on last day which was great as we didn__ fly out until early evening.  On our last morning it was a bit disappointing that the cleaner used their own key to access the apartment at 9.30am when check out wasn__ until 11.00am we were all in the middle of showering etc so we didn__ appreciate this! Pool was nice touch. Linen on beds was basic and beds were quite hard.  Only towels supplied was 1 microfiber towel per guest.  No hand towels, pool towels, tea towels, bath mats or flannels, or soap to wash hands.  Not a lot around but cheap grabs to city or restaurants."

"Great apartment. Very clean and comfortable for the amount of people. 20 mins away from the airport and 20 mins away from other main attractions. Was able to use Grab everywhere. 10 mins walk away from the metro for those who walk to take public transport. There's a 7/11 and a few restaurants steps away from the apartment, recommend using back entrance so you don't have to walk around the complex."

Quick responses to all communication. Quite and convenient location. We enjoyed our stay. Would book again.
Very responsive all the time and great place to stay for biz trip
"Mr. J's place is great for large groups,  easy to navigate and near to metro station, there is a restaurant close by with delicious food, ""pratta"" was the best. We would stay there over and over again."
Very nice place to stay and location is very strategic.
its very nice apartment and quite location ..its recommended
"The experience of being outside the general tourist area was a bonus, allowing us to mingle with the very friendly locals and experience the local markets. We had a memorable break with our family in a well appointed and expansive unit."
Bed are comfortable. Spacious unit. Looks exactly as photos shown. Great location. Plenty of parking space. Quiet neighbourhood.

Great location and pretty near to some eateries . Great host responded quickly to our enquiries. Big and spacious apartment . Definitely will come back if need to stay in a big apartment .
"Big listing and fast wifi! My only concerns were 1) the electric kettle was a bit different that the usual one. It doesn__ have a detachable base. You have the remove the plug from the kettle. We got a bit of an accident when my friend didn__ knew that and she accidentally poured boiling water on me. Please be careful using it especially if you have children around. The other concern was 2) someone came inside the listing unannounced. I did not get any message from the host but someone came inside the apartment to get something from the cabinet. Some of us felt uncomfortable with this. The good thing was all of us where there inside when the guy came. Other than those 2 things, the listing was pretty good."
"Great stay throughout at Mr J's place, highly recommend for big family travel groups"
"A good place to stay. Very clean, spacious and near to city centre"
Check in information was sent late. The property was poorly furnished. Very disappointed.
"Really good for family more than 8ppl. Place ready to stay, no need to bring amenities. Easy to check in."
"Mr.J's apartment was sparkling clean!!! Can easily accommodate 8 ppl:) but it might be too congested for more than 8 ppl. . 
Excellent location - next to Boon Keng MRT and City Centre. 
Kitchen amenities could be better. Oil and basic stuff for cooking was not kept. Utensils (pan, plates & other vessels) were also not enough. 
Bed was soft and comfortable. 
The host was quick to respond via text or call. Thank you. 
Overall, had a great stay at Mr. J's apartment."
The apartment is great for large families and is close to public transport and food centres. Rooms and beds are very   comfortable and clean. Highly recommended for those who seek local and authentic cuisines especially with the food centres and market close by.
Clean place

Nice place and good location. Fast response from Mr J. Enjoyed my stay here. Will definitely come again in future.
"Overall, it's a nice place to stay most especially if you are having a vacation with a big family. The place is just infront of a playground and very near a restaurant and 7/11 store. Definitely will comeback and recommend this place. Thanks for hosting!"
"We have been there for a business trip and everyone of us has been really enthusiast ! The neighborhood is quiet as well as the house, with easy access and many interesting features, such as the pool at ground floor! Would definitely recommend it!"

"We, a family of 10, stayed here in last week of May 2019. The place was sparkling clean, quite, and has all the amenities required to have a perfect stay. It is at a walk able distance to the Metro station (Boon Keg), and we used this to our advantage, using Metro to travel all around Singapore. Mr. J has been a wonderful host , answering all our queries promptly. Overall I would definitely recommend this place for a large group."

The place is as clean as shown in the pictures. It is especially good for a big group of people including children. Everyone is happy with the stay. The host responded promptly for questions and suggestions. We will come back and stay here again in the future.
"Here is the perfect place to stay with my family. Although many members, never crowded because of spacious place and enough rooms &bathrooms. Also Mr.J always answered me quickly. I highly recommend here."
"Great Location, clean , the host are nice, everything is good , cozy , I will stay here again next I visit Singapore.

There are a couple of MRT stops about 10 minutes away - it was in a quiet residential area, which was great for us and the kids.

Mr J was very quick with responses, and was a terrific host.

We would definitely stay there again."
Great location and Space and the  host was exceptional. Really good spot for those travelling to Singapore.

It__ a perfect place for a big group or families. It__ well maintained and clean. It__ near a lot of restaurants and train ride is around a 5-10 minute walk. Mr. J is a good host. He responds real quick. Will definitely consider staying in this place again.
"A comfortable  place for families, kids friendly, clean.  We enjoyed our stay there"
"great, nice view and comfy"
The place is clean and spacious to accommodate us :) Location wise is good as there are nice eating places nearby. Thanks !
"Nice place, nice pool,"
"Such a good place we extended our trip and stayed for a few more nights, place is wonderful and clean."
The house was really huge & clean. Location was good as well. Response from owner was speedy! We had a really great stay!
Hervie's place is very accessible to downtown and nice food centers. It is a small but beautiful room. She will suggest to put ur luggage in the storeroom because the room is small. But the view is amazing and Hervie ensures you have all the necessities you need for the stay. She is friendly and communications are easy and fast before you check in. Good host and a good place to stay especially for ladies.
"Check in/out process was smooth. Communication was always prompt. Clean apartment, great amenities. The only thing that was unexpected was that the room I got was not the room as shown in the listing. Instead of the spacious attic 1br, I was downsized to a studio on the ground floor. I was not informed of the room change prior to check in. When I asked about that, I was told it was due to a water leakage problem, which is fine. However, there was no price adjustment for downsizing from the room that I had originally paid for. I was also told the studio on the ground floor usually cost more because there's no need to climb stairs, not sure how that makes sense when usually bigger spaces tend to cost more, plus there was an elevator in the building. Make sure you check in with them ahead of time to be sure of what you're getting and if you're OK with it."
great place in town.
"The apartment is cute and homely. I did not face any problem during my stay. The biggest pro is it's location. Everything is nearby (all major attractions) and the MRT station is within 5 mins walking distance. Good bars and restaurants are within walking distance. For all foodies - The Chinatown Street Food Market, Lau Pa Sat and the Maxwell Food centre all are few mins walk away. All in all I had a good stay in this apartment."
"Die Wohnung ist fÃ¼r SingapurverhÃ¤ltnisse schÃ¶n gro_ und sauber. Sie liegt ideal in Chinatown und zur Bahn sind es keine 5 Minuten Fu_weg. Die Wohnung befindet sich an einem Ende der Club Street. Diese  ist bekannt fÃ¼r ihre vielen Bars und Restaurants. Das ist auf der einen Seite super, auf der anderen Seite hÃ¶rt man auch alles in der Wohnung (wochentags wird es zwischen 23 und 0 Uhr ruhig, am Wochenende gegen 2 Uhr). Wer also vÃ¶llige Ruhe sucht, ist hier falsch. Wer mitten im Trubel sein mÃ¶chte, ist hier komplett richtig."

"Nice and cosy place, more a hostel with small apartments than a private apartment, has everything you need, area is good located, our room in the fifth floor without windows and elevator goes till 4th floor only, still would recommend it, thx."
"The apartment is extremely well located in the middle of Chinatown and yet remains quiet, thanks to being on the top floor without windows, and the high ceilings and skylights allow it to feel open. While less spacious than the photos suggest, the space would be perfectly adequate for two people. Furnishings are quite generic and this matches the corporate approach to the management of the property (i.e. communication is either printed on a stack of rule cards or automated via WA). The mattress was adequate but not amazing. Amenities were a bit lacking__here was no iron, very little loo roll and the only soap provided was washing up liquid. But other appliances were appreciated"
"Nice and spacious apartment in a great location close to shops, restaurants, bars and transport."
"Christine's apartment is located on the top (5th) floor of a block of serviced apartments. There are steps to the lobby and the lift reaches the 4th floor so you need to carry bags up stairs. The apartment is clean and tidy with kitchen-diner and separate bedroom with sperate ensuite toilet & shower. No toiletries are provided, only one toilet roll. The double bed is comfortable and air-con in the bedroom allowed temperature to be as cold as you want. The kitchen is quite basic with a double hob and microwave. Cooking pans and utensils are sufficient to make many meals though we used the nearby (and excellent) Maxwell Hawker Center so did not cook. A small sofa wasn't particularly comfortable but sufficient for relaxing for short periods. A small dining table with four chairs was fine. TV was good but only a few channels (two English) including rolling news. Air-con in common area was powerful and capable of chilling area well. Check-in and checkout were simple and efficient and communication via (Hidden by Airbnb) was prompt and effective but only during daytime. Situated in the heart of clubland means it can be very noisy at night, especially at weekends. Friday was the worst but this did not interfere with our stay because jetlag on Friday let us sleep through the noise and other days it was no too intrusive. You MUST eat many meals at Maxwell Road hawker center. The food at all the stalls is fantastic and economical. Choose a dish and a size, pay in cash or electronically, wait a few minutes for food then sit at a table (with other diners if necessary / busy) and enjoy. It is about 25 minute walk to the harbour, then another 15 minutes to the other side. You can get a bus or MTR but we walked. On far side of harbour there is free live entertainment every night. Grab some beer from supermarket (it is expensive from bars) and sit in the outdoor venue watching a band. Great way to spend an evening or two. ""Fairprice"" is the name of the supermarket in the shipping center near China Town MTR station which provides best value for groceries. Wine is expensive but beer not too bad from supermarket. Also on the lower ground floor is a discount shop where you can get a Marsbar for 50c and other similar bargains. (My wife enjoyed the Timtams.)"
Excellent location and easy check in. Clean and tidy space and we will definitely stay again when next in Singapore.

Nice location & spacious room. Kind of noisy at night but it's no big deal. We would definitely choose here again for our next trip to Singapore :)
A very stylish and comfortable little apartment in the middle of a fantastic area of Singapore and 3 minutes walk away from Chinatown MRT station. Christine was a friendly and responsive host who made the whole process easy and stress free.
"The provided descriptions about the place is accurate, the place is bigger and more comfortable than  a couple of places near Chinatown that I have stayed before."
"Liked the place a lot, great location, nice check-in process.
But cockroaches on day 3 in kitchen, and woke up in the middle of the night with a cockroach crawling over my head the 5. night. They came and sprayed the first time, the second time I mentioned it, they did comment it which bothered me a bit. Also strong construction noises during the day, so if you plan on being there during work hours, be aware.
In total Iiked the place a lot, but wouldnt go back just because of the pest problem."
"The place was great, clean anh tidy, got everything we need. Great location, we had a great stay here."
Nice location and clean room!
great location and the place was very nice!
"Nice Christine, nice house."
"This was my second stay at Christine's place. The unit is as pictured and the location is perfect. Many restaurants nearby and walking distance to MRT and downtown. Jean and her team assisted me right away when I had an issue with wifi and they resolved it quickly. They were very helpful. I loved the easy access in and out as the building is only 5 floors and not a huge apartment complex. I read that the area can be lively at in the evenings as there are many food establishments nearby but since I stayed during Circuit Breaker, this were very quiet. I will stay here again."
Accommodation is the same as what the picture shows. Great place to stay in town!
Thumbs up!!
"Very easy & fuss-free self check in process. 

The space was clean and neat. Clean towels and toilet papers were provided. There is a small kitchen with cooker hob, fridge and washer. Overall a very simple & pleasant place for a short stay. Will book again."
"The place is alright. But I am very disappointed that I was not able to get 1 day refunded. 

I booked from 25/08 to 28/08. But I ended up only staying from 25/08 to 26/08. I checked out on the night of 26th and on the morning of 27th of August, I sent an alteration request to the host to acquire assistance on the dates stayed. The host simply said that it was too late to alter the dates, a rule which was ensued by the landlord. No where in this Airbnb listing was it stated that I had to inform more days prior for date alteration. I feel disappointed as this is very unfair on our part. Though I do apologize for the inconvenience caused, I hope the host can be more accountable in future so that other users in the future would not receive the same unfair treatment."
"Estelle was kind enough to provide a late check-in and help us with our huge amount of luggage. 

Her place is really cosy and the River Valley location is fantastic. Really enjoyed our stay."
The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
Had booked the place for my Mother in law who is elderly and not so savvy on directions etc. KY was very caring and helpful in ensuring she managed to check in and check out smoothly and even took the extra step to help her w departure on her last day.
"Great place to stay, and an amazing host."
The place is very clean and cozy. There__ a shopping mall nearby and a LRT station so it is very convenient to shop and travel around the city with less walkings. The host is very nice and the hospitality is amazing.
"The house is comfortable, clean and close to petir lrt station."
Good place with great location. Clean and comfortable
"Highly recommended, convenient location near lrt station  "
"Ky is a great person, have a quick response, and helpful. The place is clean and well-maintained."
"Our stay here was very nice. We arrived very late and all went well with the check in, May and Lennard are the best hosts. Bit far from the city, but an LRT next door and enough spots to get some nice food around the corner. Would definitly come back here when in Singapore!"
Very good place to stay and easy to access :)
"Ky is a good host - he__ very kind and even offered us to prepare some local baked goods together.
In the flat you will be staying with May - we didn__ really see her around very often, she would occasionally ask us to remember to switch the light off in our bathroom or turn the AC off when we__e not in the room.
The apartment looks pretty much exactly like in the pictures, it is very close to the LRT/MRT stations a little far from the city centre though.
We had a pleasant stay in there for a month."
"I and my partner spend 3 months at this place. Ky was very helpful and reliable during our stay. For example, when we didn't have enough hangers in the room he came by and brought us some extra. To us it was a surprise that did not live with us, instead, May was our flatmate. She was generally a quiet neighbour who has always respected our privacy but we sometimes felt that her rules are too strict. The flat was very tidy and clean, it was sometimes even intimidating. The aircon worked well (which is very useful in Singapore) but blows directly on the bed which sometimes gave me a sore throat. It was a shame that we weren't allowed to use the kitchen during our stay, but Ky did make an exception for us for a farewell lunch which was really nice. The flat was super close to the LRT and MRT station but Singapore central is almost an hour public transport. It was also surprising for us that the window was not sealed but only shutters looking to the corridor. This meant that at night a bit of wind, noise and light came in. So if you are not a good a sleeper you may want to use earplugs and eye cover.  All in all, for the price we paid for the accommodation, was worth it."
"walking distance for 24hours supermarket, and steps away from the bus and LRT station."
"I stayed here for 4 weeks. 
This place is very nice, regarding of high costs of accomodation in Singapore. It deserves 5 stars out of 5 

Few things I want to mention
1. There is a resident in this house who have lived for a long time. You will share this house with this resident. But your bedroom, bathroom is totally isolated from that of the resident. And you will be provided one mini refrigerator which you can use it independently. Things you might share are washer, and drying rack(which is quite unique one than in my country.) 

2. Number of body towels are provided. And you can use it by the end of your residence. There are a lot of hangers in the room,  so you don't need to worry about your shirts. Also, iron is provided. Also, there is a charger that has many inputs, so you don't need to worry about  adapters, for travelers who had use chargers in 220V in their country. 

3. The resident who lives in this house is very clean person, who maintains house in highly clean state. What you have to mind in living is 3 things; Don't close the door hardly, Off lights and air-conditioners when you are out, and don't eat wet foods in your room. 

4. Not eating wet foods is very important advice to you, because of the ants. Ants will attack foods that are left around, for 100% possibility in Singapore. 

5. This place is so convenient for eating, and taking a public transport. Especially for this apartment, the bus stop is just 15 seconds far from the Level 1 of the apartment. LRT station is 1min far. Also, there is a market just 2min far from this residence, which consists of coffee shops, stationery, supermarket, and local GP clinic. There are 3 shopping malls you can go in 10mins (Bukit Panjang Plaza, Hillion Mall, Junction 10) , and two big hawker centres that you can go in 15 mins .

6. You can travel a lot of places very comfortably. But what i want to mention is bus 960. It goes to Woodlands, which has a checkpoint to Johor Bahru, Malaysia. This residence is definitely a good place if you are planning travels to Johor Bahru. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place for your residency in Singapore."
"Spartan living, but good location, right in the middle of chinatown"
The host canceled this reservation 17 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
Jayanthi really helped a lot and very helpful during the stay. Much appreciated. Thanks again...
"The place suits best for family and a small group. Private, cosy and easy access!"
"The room is near the mrt but it__ a quite noisy place especially Sunday. The room we lived have no wifi, we can only share the wifi with other room. There is not enough quilts, but it__ a comfortable place overall."
The place is nice and cozy
"We (2 adults and 2 kids) stayed at Bella's apartment for about a week. Her residence was an amazing apartment with fully equipped kitchen.
The apartment was very clean and pretty close (300 mtr)  to MRT and walkable distance to famous Indian restaurants like A2B and many other good restaurants. And also close to Mustafa center and many of departmental stores. 
Important thing about the host was , she is very supportive and kind enough to provided very early check-in at 6am in the morning and she personally came handed over the key and informed all the information about the apartment and nearby places. 
During the stay she was able to answer all queries and guided us properly to make our stay comfortable. 
She was kind enough that even accepted to do a late check-out in the mid night at 1:30am. During the mid-night checkout we forgot the key inside and locked the door then she was kind enough to send her person to open the apartment in the midnight. 
It__ not about only just apartment, the comfort and support we got from her was amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at her residence. 
Overall it was a great experience for us !!"
"Quick response, near MRT station and around halal eating places, thanks Bella"
"Bella__ place is good place to stay.
Very close from mrt station (farrer park) and bus stop. 
It also very close to little India
The place also very clean, response is fast.
Recommended place to stay..
Thanks Bella"
Great place to stay and value for money.
"Location was good, within walking distance to attractions like Mustafa Center and Swee Choon Tim Sum. Only a few minutes away from the MRT station as well. The host Bella was very friendly, hospitable and helpful. She let us check in early, and quickly responded when the lift stopped working one morning. Helper was cheerful and helped us settle into the apartment well. Apartment was clean and spacious. Overall a great stay."
This place is much better than I expected. It is close to MRT certain exit. The place is very spacious. The bed is comfortable. It has everything you need. The housekeeper was also very friendly. I will definitely book this place again if I travel to Singapore.
Clean and cozy place to stay in. Equip with everything we need. We use the rice cooker to steam some baby food:) they provide baby high chair too. But the house don__ have dining table :D We enjoy staying in. Bella and the housekeeper are very friendly and always give us a fast respond. Bella provide us a lots of local tips too! That__ very useful for us. Thanks! A happy stay indeed.
Bella and Puji were so friendly and helpful. They really made me feel at home. The apartment and its facilities meet all my requirements. Its layout and location have made my stay very comfortable. I am very happy with the way the apartment is set up and the services they provide. Thank you Bella and Puji. I will surely like to stay again in your apartment in future. All the best.
The place is very clean with all amenities! It was very comfortable and an absolute bonus when we saw a washing machine in the apartment! I would recommend this place!
Nice apartment for 2-3 persons. Clean and cozy with a balcony. Recommended to stay for a few days. Very close to mrt station and just a few stops from the city center. Great communication with Bella. I would love to stay again in the apartment.
Very nice place. Have all the required amenities in the apartment. Metro station farrer park is only 3mins walking distance. We enjoyed our stay. Want to come again in future. Ms. Bella is undoubtedly a good host. I recommend to everyone. Thanks
We had a lovely stay. The MRT Farrer Park is very close to the place and makes it easy to move around the city. The place was very clean and had all the required amenities. The only problem was that it didn__ have enough chairs or mugs for four people.
"The apartment is easy to find,close to MRT,and there is a 24hours supermarket nearby. Many Indian live around. Bella is nice and kind,thank u!"
Nice flat. Very quick response by the host. Unfortunately the wifi wasn't great.
"Great location steps to Ferrar Park MRT.  Quiet, clean, with a washing machine. It's in Little India. It was very easy to visit Chinatown and Gardens by the Bay. The neighborhood felt safe at night, but I would expect the same anywhere in Singapore."
Excellent location in little India. Near the famed Mustafa centre and the art wall .
"The location is very convenient.The room was clean and comfortable, and the transportation was convenient."
"Our stay at Bella__ was easy, safe, and very pleasant. The space was clean, check in was a breeze, and she communicated with us responsively.  Our only complaint is that the WiFi was unreliable, but otherwise we recommend this space and host."
"Pretty valued place, nice and clean"
Stayed at Bella__ place again and it didn__ disappoint as usual. Beautiful and clean apartment in an excellent location. Communication was great and check-in was convenient. Definitely staying at Bella__ again soon.
"Good and spacious. Host was very nice and it is as accurate as mentioned . 

Very gd location and nice apartment"
"Balla's apartment is a great place to base yourself in Singapore, either for a day or two or for a full week, as we did. The absolutely best thing about this place is the location -- right in the heart of Little India, close to everything you need and amazing food in every direction. 
The place is cleaned every couple days, and you can do your own laundry, which is super helpful."
Overall Tip-top & Flawless 
"The place is nice. A little hard to find at first. Only bad thing is no shelter to anywhere. So if it rains, you__l get wet. No sheltered pick up/drop off points. Other than that all is ok "
nice place thanks for having us
"Great host, very accommodating and check in process was made very easy"
Ok
"The place is clean, comfortable and the location is convenient. Nearby amenities like eating places, mall and sub station."
Nice and clean. Easy check in process
Nice place
Nice cosy place to stay! Good location too!
Comfortable place to stay in
Clean place to stay in. Thumb up 
Awesome place

Excellent accommodation. Super clean and spacious! Stylish space.
Awsome
Great place and very clean worth the stay
"Reliable and Prompt response from host, very clean apartment. Overall comfortable stay! Looking forward to the coming stay:)"
Super clean! Furniture and apartment well maintained. Managed to get a good night's sleep. Even have basic cable tv  to watch. Nice comfy bed. Very responsive.
Good experience
"Clean, convenient and friendly! Would stay again."
It__ an outstanding stay. It__ clean and convenient where you can get your necessities. Easy to locate and clear instructions to guide you as well. Recommended!  Thanks Bella! 
"Bella and Puji were super responsive and helpful, and the place was clean and cosy. Great location too, with many eateries and convenience stores around. Would stay again!"
A good and comfortable room for staycations.
Sparkling clean and fast response. Stayed here another time.
Very clean unit and ideal location. Would definitely recommend others  too.
The place is super clean..
A recommended place
It was a great place for staycation. Located at a quiet place which was well suited for us. Clean and tidy too. Would stay here again!
Good and accurate
Host was quick to respond and ensured all was ok. Thank you.
Bella is communicative and quick to answer any questions I had - including my early check in request. Apartment was clean and located in a convenient location. Superb!
Not bad
"Fast response, clean room , comfort bed, strategic location  . Strongly recommended to those looking for a fantastic stay experience."
Place was cosy & clean! very friendly host
If you are thinking of going to Singapore look for Daniela's place. It's so close to the airport and close to the train to take you into the city. On top of that Daniela is so friendly and trusting and is fun to hang out with. She will give you tips on things to do or to skip. Her place is clean and spacious and she's a great hostess overall. I'm so glad I found her place to stay at and fully recommend her and her hospitality to everyone looking for an AirBnB in Singapore!
"Near amenities, sparkling clean, friendly host"
"Daniela's place, as well as Daniela herself were great! The apartment is conveniently located on the metro line that takes you from Changi Airport to the city centre, in addition to being spacious, light and very clean! The room is just like in the photos and features an AC that is a life saver in the tropical Singapore weather! Daniela gave us a warm welcome despite our delayed arrival, and had the answers to all our questions, plus some very good recommendations in terms of where to go and what to eat around Singapore! Thank you for your hospitality Daniela, we had a lovely stay with you!"
Great place and value. Close to hawker centres with good food. Easy access with public transport. Host is easy to communicate with.
Markets and laundry are very convenient. Room is clean.  Good choice
"Pretty ordinary spot to rest over on a long trip 
No towels and impersonal approach to a welcoming stay over 
Basic and uninspiring despite the pictures"
"THE HOUSE IS CLOSE SUBWAY STATION,AND THERE IS A BIG FOOD COURT ON THE SIDE ,IT IS VERY CONVENIENT.DANIEAL IS VERY KIND,TKS."
"Clean, rustic, shared toilet and bath and washing machine not included (washing and drying station is 3 mins walk from the apartment)."
"The location is very good, very easy to get to the CBD area. The house is in the gated community. However, the bed, blanket and pillow is very old, need a change. We have to do a deep cleaning on the first day. And, we have to buy a basic kitchen stuff like spoon, mugs, plates, spoon and plates for our morning coffee. The house need a proper cleaning ad there is hairs from the previous travelers/tenants. Moreover, the host come to the house unannounced daily for cleaning but it is not mention in the descriptions. I was in the middle of the shower and he has the second key. Fortunately, we use the manual lock for the door. We feel unsafe to put our valuable in the house. Another note, it is a very nice locations, nice house, nice host, and low price. There is a saying : what you buy, what you get. The higher the price of a product, the higher quality you will get, it works vice versa. Cheers :)"
Good place and location and host was helpful. However there was no cleaning during the stay even though it was supposed to be provided
"Bert should be an AirBnB __uperhost_, immediately! Awesome communication, prompt responses and went out of his way to provide advice, additional kitchen implements and a lift to Marina Bay Sands on his way home. Great __ersonal touches_ with snacks etc. 

His place is immaculate, well equipped and perfect for a couple. It__ in a very quiet area outside of town but very well connected by bus/MRT to all major attractions. Lovely refreshing pool after a long days sightseeing and a cool gym. 

Here is a very brief itinerary of my short, but awesome stay in Singapore.

Day 1
Arrive 17:00 from Sydney. 
Get SGD30 SIM card which gives you 100GB data (only available to tourists) and SGD35 - airport cab to River Edge.

Dump stuff and get bus/cab to Marina Bay Sands. SGD22 for entrance to C_ LA VI for amazing views of the bay and the city. You get this back in credit for food/drink but this only got me two bitesize duck rolls. Don__ go up to the (Hidden by Airbnb) ark Observatory, it costs more, you don__ get the credit for food, and you can__ see the famous infinity pools but you can from C_ LA VI! 

Cab/bus home and rest.

Day 2
Morning:
Short 20mins walk to Orchard Station to catch MRT red line to Kranji (approx 50mins) where you alright and catch the 170X bus to Woodlands checkpoint which takes you across the border into JB, Malaysia.   Passport control is busy going into Malaysia so try and go early to miss the __raffic_ but coming back into Singapore was a breeze. There isn__ much except a shopping centre on the Malaysian side, but it was worth a passport stamp but if you have time, definitely better to head further up to Malacca/Kuala Lumpur.

Afternoon/Evening:
Get back to Kranji and then head to Marina Bay to see Gardens by the Bay and mooch around admiring the view of the Marina Bay Sands from below.

Day 3
Morning:
Bus 65 is 5 mins walk and goes directly to HarbourPoint in around 20mins and get a cruises/ferry to Batam, Indonesia  for SGD49 - Another passport stamp. You can pay directly with Visa/MasterCard on the bus and it__ only SGD 0.10! 

Afternoon/Evening:
Return to Harbour Point and head over on the cable car on/around Sentosa - get all day ticket for SGD55. It__ expensive and touristy, but worth a look. Head up on the cable car to Mount Faber for food and sundowners at __usk_ restaurant/bar. Expensive (SGD10 for a half pint) but a good view and nice and chilled. There is also a light show up there at 8pm. After that head back down on the cable car and get the bus from HarbourPoint back to RV Edge.

It is crazy that a ferry to another country costs less than a few cable car rides but that__ the way it is at most tourist destinations. 

Day 4:
Morning:
7:30 am 5km Parkrun at West Coast Park.

Afternoon:
Sightseeing on Hop on hop off bus, get off and walk around in Little India and China Town.

Evening:
19:00 head to airport to catch 22:35 flight to London. 

Goodbye Singapore! 


Thank you for everything!"
"Beth is helpful and responsive host. I am impressed by his sincerity.

I would  strongly recommend his apartment if you are coming to Singapore for shopping as the famous Orchard Shopping District is just around the corner. It is ideal for business trip too as the apartment is just minutes away from the CBD area. 

Thank Beth for your hospitality."
"Bert is a great host, his apartmen is clean and fully furnished with all you need. He is a very thoughtful host and never hesitate to go the extra mile. Thanks for all your help!"
"Enjoyed our stay, thanks."
Bert place is located in the middle of town. Wonderful place to stay and it__ really clean and cozy
Amazing host.
"Bert__ place was beyond amazing. Everything was in the apartment, from utensils to amenities. It was very clean too.
Apart from that, Bert have prepared some thoughtful touches before we arrive. You do not have to worry as Bert is quick in response too. 
Very friendly and easy going host ive met! 
Thank you Bert (;"
"Bert was an amazing host who went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and provide us with lots of local knowledge about food, transport travel hotspots. The place was very clean and tidy. Overall a great stay, and would recommend for future travellers."
Best airbnb stay ever. Host is super helpful friendly basically went above and beyond.  Highly recommend.
Great!
Bert was a great host. Very clean place and great communication. Provided basic amenities even comparable with hotel standards. Cooking utensils and basic cooking materials were also provided with nice touch of sweets!!! Checking out and checking in was a breeze! Thanks for helping me to retrieve my left luggage at your place! One of the best Airbnb places I have ever stayed at. Wonderful host and perfect place to stay in. A+++

"Great location, extremely friendly host and very responsive. Short walk to a supermarket called Fair Price. Also short walk to Zion Riverside Food Centre where you can eat in front of the river. Would recommend using Grab (ride sharing app) to get around."
It was a smooth experience from the beginning to end. We did not have the chance to check in before late night but Bert was super helpful and informative and checked us into his place easily and very fast. The place was small as you could expect Singapore but is filled with touches which makes it more like home. The amenities were plenty and even more than expected! Bert has done a great job upkeeping the place as it was clean and neat. The wifi/mifi is for both in-house and outdoor usage which could help lots of folks traveling with limited data (a tip: double click and hold the power button to fix connection problems). In any cases Bert has always been able to show the lighter side of everything and shown his best in resolving problem! Totally recommendable!!!
"Bert embodies the spirit of Airbnb, the heartfelt desire to make the world a better place through building personal connections across cultures.  He should definitely be a super host!  He went out of his way to check us in personally and to show us how to work all the appliances and where to find everything.  He provided lots of local tips and advice.  He even got us a fresh warm local breakfast of Nasi Lemak and delivered it to us Saturday morning!  He really cared that we had a good time and made himself available for all our many questions!  Great host!"
"Great host who ensures seamless check in, great hospitality and timely response to queries. Photos are 100% accurate."
The host canceled this reservation 20 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
Berto was a great host. Easy to communicate with and was very helpful. The place was as expected - clean and check in was Super easy!
"It feels like home. We stayed 8 nights and we dont want to leave.  It is 3 bus stop away to Orchard Rd (10 min ride).  

Most imporatant thing, there is  Starbucks & Supermarket just accross the road from the apartment. 

Mr. Bert (the host) was super nice. Thank you Bert, we will come back soon."
"Great place for two people. Kind helpful host. Best I've encountered so far. I was pleasantly surprised by his manners. Really enjoyed the communication. 

The place was exactly as described, amenities and everything. Lots of extra stuff in the kitchen without having to ask beforehand, even though it was mentioned that there should be a prior notice for light cooking arrangements. 

Good price too considering location, but could have been priced a bit lower. 

I'll definitely seek out Berto next time I visit Singapore."
"Berto is very nice and considerate! He provides bottle waters, cokes, chocolate, cookies etc as well as the precious face mask! Very nice host and very good location near supermarket, good restaurant and the jogging path!"
Berto was amazing to communicate with and the hospitality was very appreciated. Location is great and accessibility to the city is quick and easy. Definitely recommend
very accommodating host and a cozy apartment
"___äººå_å¥,nice"
Liu and Zhong are a very friendly couple. Can talk to them about anything.
"Liu's appartement is located about 5min walking distance from MRT Pioneer underground station, from where there depart regular free shuttle buses to NTU, and of course regular train services to the centre and airport. The appartement is located in the 15th floor and has a great view northwards in direction of the NTU campus. The room is basic with a double bunk bed, a desk with lamp and chair and a wardrobe. There is an airco and fan in the room. You can use wifi, the fridge and laundry machine. Food stalls are located at the MRT and halfway between the accommodation and MRT campus. The host family was niece and friendly. The appartement is clean and quiet and I can recommend it for anyone who comes from oversees to work at NTU and needs a temporary room before renting a place permanently."
"The family is so nice, and everything is in order. They are very helpful."
"Nice and kindly family. It was very convince to go pioneer MRT station and NTU. I recommend this house for NTU user, sightseeing and so on."
"Liu__ place is close to Pioneer MRT station so no problem with transportation. She responds very fast with my enquiry and my check in was very smooth. Her family was nice. She__ also caring, when I checked out she gave me a mask to use for protection (corona virus outbreak). I appreciate it! Thank you!!!!"
"Very close to MRT Pioneer and free Campus Rider bus to NTU, but also an Athletics center with swimming pool right in front of the block. Adorable and helpful family, everything was perfect during my stay."
"Magnificent experience! Very responsive, helpful, beautiful place. Cheerful host! Answered my many queries and told me places of attraction. Conveniently located near town. With a supermarket right downstairs and food all around, highly recommended."
"A great place to stay!! The room is spacious, cozy, and most importantly sparkling clean! Room is cleaned everyday and the host is friendly. The location itself is superb, there are many places to eat from hawkers to cafes just 5 minutes walk from the place. Really value for money!!"
"Great location, close to bus stops and an MRT station. Friendly host."
"It was a super clean room, nice host and comfortable stay! Thank you very much Ian and your family!"
"It was clean and comfortable. 
My private is protect because the room are not adjacent, I don__ mind the noise, and the room can be locked.
The room wider than business hotels same price or higher in Tokyo.
Host and staff are kind persons."
"Ian is a great host, he is very responsive and helpful.  The location is as I wished for, near MacRitchie Reservoir Park.  It is easy to get around as bus stop is just in front or another one is just minutes away by foot and MRT is 2 bus stop away.  It is surrounded by nice eating places and a supermarket is just downstairs.   The room__ size is just nice for me.  Bathroom is nice and clean.  The helper is there to assist and helpful.  Overall, it was a great stay.  Will come back again next time."
"Highly Recommended;) Very nice location. The bus stop is just in front of the apartment to get to the nearest MRT Station. Super clean and tidy room, not only the room, everywhere in the house!! Wifi is avail, super nice host Ian helped me to set up wifi connection with my 3 devices:) He is always caring, nice n kind and approachable. Whenever I ask something, he__l answer back right away. Around the apartment, there are a lot of places to eat, n there is also a supermarket down stair which is very convenient. I__e tried the massage place near by, one is Balinese and the other place name Healing Touch. Both are awesome:):) I wish to come back and stay again in not so distant future. Many thanks again to Ian and special thanks to his lovely maid. Best Regards, Akari"
A well kept place and a good night's sleep. The host provided very clear instructions on how to get there and was very welcoming upon arriving. It's about a 5 min walk to the mrt and has a market in the basement of the building with plenty of food options nearby.
"Ian ist ein sehr hÃ¶flicher und freundlicher Gastgeber. Seine Hausfrau kÃ¼mmert sich um alle Belange und ist die gute Seele des Hauses. Die Wohnung ist sehr ansprechend, ich habe mich sehr wohl gefÃ¼hlt. 
Die Bushaltestelle ist genau vor der TÃ¼r (gÃ¼nstig), MRT einige Gehminuten entfernt. In unmittelbarer NÃ¤he gibt es viele LokalitÃ¤ten mit sehr guter KÃ¼che."
I stayed for a month and found it somehow comfortable. The bathroom was always clean and tiny. Though inside the place was dark and no sunshine. It's more suitable to male rather than female.
"Great location with easy access MRT, coffee shop, reservoir... supermarket in same building, Bus just in front of building. Central to discover SGP. Quiet private room with AC. Bathroom, kitchen and Laundry shared. Ian always ready to help and share tips. Spent some time here, without counting days, weeks... Oups, finally months ! :) Time for me to leave. Thanks Ian !"

"We stayed at Z__ place for 4 nights. We were a family of 8 plus little kids.  We liked the spacious dining and living areas where we could gather and wait for each other while getting ready for Singapore attractions. The beds and beddings were comfy. The place was well stocked with towels, toiletries, coffee, tea, and even bedroom slippers and travel adaptors for our gadgets. The bathrooms were clean but a bit dated and could use a little upgrade. The location is great - lots of food options in the building and the area outside, a convenience store, and connected to Tanjong Pagar station.  Overall, we had a great stay in Singapore. We would book this place again when visiting with a group."

One of the best Airbnb's that we have ever stayed at. Thanks Z!
Was a great space for a large party. Very convenient location. Host was great to deal with
Very nice and spacious apartment. Highly recommended.
"Z's place is great for a family or group of friends looking to be in the middle of Singapore.  Chinatown was a quick walk away, Marina Bay Sands area is a quick taxi/Grab ride away. There's a great selection of restaurants, and stores within a few blocks walking distance and inside the lower level of the building itself.  The living and dining areas are quite spacious, and the bedrooms are comfortable. Beds were comfy with good quality sheets and covers.  The onsite washer and dryer were a big plus, especially since this was toward the end of our trip.  The en suite bathrooms were okay but needed some TLC.  The third bathroom is more of a wet room with shower, but no separate shower stall. The kitchen is well equipped, even including a rice cooker.  Overall, this was a really good stay."
"Top convenient location steps from subway and bus , restaurants inside building very good. Will stay again.
Host very quick response"
Great place to stay
Spacious place for big group of people.
"The address listed is incorrect, so make sure you reach out to the host beforehand to verify the address."
"It's located in a very nice area. Very easy to find eateries, near to MRT station.  The host provides us with good quality amenities.  And its very easy to contact the host in case of urgency."
"The host was great in communications, responded to all enquiries in a very timely matter. The host is very accommodating and have meet our requests even if it was last minute. Great host and very easy to deal with. 
The property offers 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, however 1 bathroom would be considered as a toilet with a standing (uncontained) shower. Bathrooms weren__ too flashy but usable.
The location was the best, MRT just downstairs, walking distance to the best hawker centres, Chinatown etc. Food, convenience store, coffee, beauty salons downstairs."
"Location is so convenient, close to MRT, some restaurants in downstairs and nearby. Maxwell food court is about 10 mins by walk. Alex is helpful and replied the message quickly and clear.
Recommend for family trip."

"The apartment was large and spacious for our family and in a convenient area with MRT, coffee & convenience stores, restaurants, money changer downstairs and less than 10 minutes walk to Amoy Maxwell and Tanjong Pager hawkers centers. Host was very communicative and responded promptly whenever we had any inquiries and accommodating to our requests."
"The apartment have a great location in Singapore. 1 min to the metro. 
Alex is friendly and reactive. 
There are 3 toilets but small. 
It__ enough for a short stay."
"The apartment is spacious, quiet, well equipped and in a great location. It offered everything we needed.   The manager responded fast and well to our questions."
"Location is perfect-right near the MRT, upstairs from various food/fast food/coffee/ 
7/11 and amentities. Across the road is restaurants and shopping options. Gym, Pool, Security all present. 
Apart is clean and contains the basics for what you require. Nice view! If you have a group/family this is a really good option. 
Communication was great and any little hiccup was immediately attended too. Thanks for having us:)Highly recommend for your Singapore stay!"
We had a great stay at Alex's place. Even though there was transit right outside we were able to walk everywhere with the central location. All sorts of food and shops right in the tower. Quite comfortable for the seven of us staying there.
"Alex  place is just as described. Very comfortable for a group or family, and a convenient location for walking or taking taxis or public transport around the city. The high floor offered a nice breeze and a quieter experience than neighboring buildings on lower floors."
"This place was wonderful for first timers to Singapore. It was an easg walk to Chinatown, a hawker eatery, and the metro. Convenient 100%."
Apartment was as we had expected. No issues while we stayed.
"Good central location, close to CBD and minutes from MRT station within 2minutes walking distance but property fixtures a bit dated"
"have you ever found yourself wondering - how can an apartment EVER live up to my expectations?
well I certainly have. And let me just start this off by saying my BOI alex set us up with a partay-hause like none other!
Furthermore the local community is out of this world - cute neighbors and all the grab-drivers were pretty lit as well.
Mic drop, peace out. L8er h8ers"
"Lim was such an excellent host, he stayed up till late night to help us get to his place and welcome us.. Gave us a thorough tour of his place.. Amazing host"
Great host and wonderful place
"Place is truly value for money. Been smooth sailing pretty much. Was happy booking 2 rooms for my large family.

Rooms are spacious, luxurious. Host is friendly and ensures we are comfortable. Very appreciative that they were able to share their exotic fruits with us. My kid was very happy with the toy that they gave her. Much thanks for that.

I wish to not write a positive review because by doing so, the place might always be fully booked and I won't get the chance to stay here again... but then they do deserve it! 

Will surely come back here to stay again (if not booked)"
HAVE TO WALK 5MINS. TO BUS STOP AND IF WANT MORE CONVENIENCES TAKE GRAB TAXI
The room we stayed was very big and comfortable for the 4 of us.  Lim's response was extremely fast. Our boys enjoyed playing pingpong whenever they are back at Lim's place.
"The house is very nice. My friends and my family spent wonderful time!!~ Thanks, Lim!!"
"If you are looking for comfort and relaxing environment, Lim__ place it is. 

It was a pleasant stay and the host was accommodating enough."
This is a very nice spacious room in a quiet neighbourhood. Lim__ family is very thoughtful seeing that they prepare all the USB charger for guest to use. Recommended stay.
Lim's very friendly. Fast response if we request anything and I get a free gift new powerbank for free from him. Much thanks! Will stay here again once we come back to Singapore 
"Great place as described, clean and comfortable. Do note that the bathroom is not en-suite for the Large Room but situated outside the room (though it is for the exclusive use for occupants of the Large Room). Friendly and responsive hosts. Thanks for the stay!"
"The place is nice and well equipped, but the entry process is a bit enconvenient."
"The room which we occupied was really spacious. Fits the description as advertised _ large _.
Host is quick to respond through airbnb messaging.
I was expecting that towels will be readily available when we checked in but there was none. So, we have to go buy.  Anyway Lim asked but we already bought our towels. 
The place is a little bit far from city__ main attractions. But taxi is affordable. And Lim was nice enough to share tips. You can see written instructions on cardboards inside the room. 
I rated the stay 4/5 because I believe that nobody or nothing is perfect. 
I highly recommend the place."

"Die Unterkunft befindet sich in einer sehr ruhigen Gegend, ist vom Zentrum ca. 10km entfernt und mit Ã¶ffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln umstÃ¤ndlich erreichbar. Taxipreise liegen zw. 15 - 25S$.
Das Zimmer ist sehr sperlich eingerichtet. Das Bad ist zwar au_erhalb des Zimmers, ist jedoch dem Zimmer zugeordnet. Die KÃ¼che ist eine GemeinschaftskÃ¼che mit sehr wenig ZubehÃ¶r,  GeschirrtÃ¼cher waren nicht vorhanden."
"It__ a good and lucky place for SAT, my son just got 1580 high score."
"Large room with Netflix, AC, big comfy bed and a mini fridge. Bathroom is located outside the room but it__ dedicated only to you. Room is located at the second floor of the house. There is a bus stop about 750 m away as well as a mall with 7-11 and food court."
Nice house and quiet place.
It's was nice. My parents really had a pleasant time. It was a quiet place to stay.
"For Going to Bus Stop , You have to walk 10 mins or take a grab."
"the stay is good and pleasant, the house is quiet and the room is huge :)"
.
I had a very comfortable stay at Lim's house.  Great neighbourhood; very quiet and peaceful.
Very quiet and tidy place. Also a great neighborhood and great view through the window.

Lim's house is a great find.  Beautiful design.  Large clean rooms.  Good feeling of privacy for each guest.    Short pleasant walk to lots of bus options that easily feed into the MRT grid (or ride Grab).  Great place to come home to after a day/night of SG adventures.  Supermarket and inexpensive food options just up the street.  I plan to stay here again!!!
Awesome place. Extremely nice and helpful host. Everything was perfect
Mr Lim's mother was very thoughtful and caring. The communication was fast. We had a pleasant stay there. The room is large and very comfortable. Really worth the money. We definitely will be back with another family trip. Thank you Mr Lim and your mother! :)
"Lim is very nice and showing welcome to us. The house is petty and comfortable, after 5 min walk have a small mall which is quick convenient. We had a really good time."
Awesome window view
"The place is exactly how it describes on the site. We stayed in the ""Large room"", spacious and clean with free Netflix :) The room does not have attached bathroom, which is located just outside the room. We enjoy the patio next to the swimming pool and you can do laundry too. Expect to walk about 10 minutes to nearest bus stops, then to MRT stations.
Look for other room options ( Cozy/Nice) if you prefer attached bathroom."
As per description 
"This is my third time staying in Alex's house with my gf. We really enjoyed ourselves very much for our stay. The location of the house was within 15mins walk to the nearest bus stop and 20-30mins bus ride to the nearest shopping mall.

Alex's house is very quiet and peaceful which is a rarity in today's singapore. My gf and me had a really good rest in his house and she could concentrate well in completing her assignment. Also, the TV with Netflix in the room provided us with much entertainment and the fridge allowed us to keep unfinished food in it. 


I will definitely recommend this stay to travellers and staycationers. This is certainly value for money!"
Great host
"Hani est une hÃ´te vraiment trÃ¨s sympa, elle m'a invitÃ© _ manger chez elle avant mÃªme que je dÃ©barque dans son airbnb et m'a permis de rencontrer pleins de personnes. Le logement est vraiment bien, les chambres sont grandes et la clime est neuve :) faites peut-Ãªtre attention si vous Ãªtes sensible au bruit de la route, prÃ©voyez simplement des boules quiece."
"Hani is an amazing host and super thoughtful! The place is quite well located in a very hip neighborhood and there is a famous  hawker nearby, just 5 mins by walk and many other restaurants and bars. I have a nice stay in Hani's place!"
Hani is really a great host! Always available if you need anything concerning the room or even informations and advices concerning Singapore. The house is great and well located to discover Sg and nearby everything you need
"Ein sehr schickes (nicht allzu gro_es) Apartment in einem wunderschÃ¶nen und sehr gepflegten Condo. Gute Lage, Marina Bay zu Fu_ erreichbar und ein feundlicher Gastgeber. VollumfÃ¤ngliche Weiterempfehlung."
great hospitality and great place to stay!
"Better then expected overall experience. stayed for 5nights. 
Pls Mind the top bed next to shower though(big structure beam crossing yr bed & kinda noisy from ppl showering)"
Thank you til next time
"Check in was bad because the host did not respond to clarify my questions. I had to call the host via a friend's friend who happen to live in Singapore to determine what is the check in instructions.

Other than that, the apartment was clean and the location is great!"
I had a wonderful time at Beary Best's. The staff was very good and helpful. It was a very nice experience.
"The unit itself was quite alright. Clean, well prepared, however there are open switches on the  floor in the middle of the unit that juts out and is quite hazardous and easy to trip over.  The listing doesn't mention it, but there might be two different units that are identical that are owned by the same host and you may get one or the other. The unit I got was not the one in the image and certain things were different. 

The location was quite convenient and near to many amenities and near a station and big mall. However, it can get noisy at night and is technically located above shop lots so the entrance itself is somewhat behind a business which wasnt mentioned in the listing"
Check in information is clear and simple. It just a few minutes walk to MRT station and shopping mall. The room is clean and tidy.
"As your room was not suitable for stay, my family left your room immediately on July 5th. pls refund all as you agreed. Your room has torn wall paper with  mold, many ants all around, dirty pillow, far from city center and no restaurant near house. That room was worst our family ever seen. Pls refund immediately. ( i would send photos taken from this room as self explanatory of room condition)"
I personally recommend this place of stay. Great response and understanding for Mrs.Jayanthi. Thanks for making our stay memorable.
"Great place, great location, barely 2 minutes from famous mustafa shopping center."

We haven__ met the host but she was in touch with us through whatsup to make sure everything was fine.

What do you need more? :)"
"Mrs Jayanthi she is wonderful person, I was amazed with her behaviour & hospitality.. she is so caring lady .. love you lady _¤ï_.."
äº¤é_¾¿_ _¿ä___å¥½å
Quick response. Place was ready when I went in. Didn__ have any troubles at all.
"Great apartment, very clean and the communication with bella worked out perfectly. She always answers within minutes and helps with every upcoming problem."
"We had a great time staying here. Check in was super easy, and Bella was immediately responsive to any questions we had. 

The room was modern, updated and the air con was a life saver!

The location was great, located in the heart of Little India. We mainly used Grab but it__ very close to the MRT station. There are even vendors open late near the building where we were able to get water, snacks and other things we needed. Highly recommend this place!"
Beschreibung entspricht der RealitÃ¤t. Kurzer Weg zu U-Bahn. Super Lage um in die Stadt zu kommen. Einkaufscenter und Restaurants in direkter Umgebung.
"Location is convenient. 
House keeper comes to clean nearly every day. I thought airbnb will only clean after guest check out, but this apartment has clean service nearly every day, which I really appreciate. 
Also the host helped us to resolve the socket issue very quickly."
Great location and wonderful access to rest of the city.
"In check-out day, host wake up me at morning... It__ not good."
"Bella's place is very convient.  Bella will come to clean the room which normal ABNB won't do.  in the weekday,  the place is very quite with all sight seeing spots within Grab taxi. strongly recommend to stay here."
"it a studio unit with a queen bed and a sofa bed. Comes with washing machine and microwave. Location is strategic as it's near the MRT station. Entrance to the private parking for the unit is a little narrow. Unit is clean. Can be a little noisy as it's facing the main road. 

Overall, enjoyed my stay there. Thanks!"
Bella's place is a great value place. It's close to the MRT and bus stations and the host is very good at responding to us in a timely manner. I'd recommend this place to anyone!
Bella__ place was amazing and her hospitality was outstanding. The apartment is conveniently located at the heart of the city. My stay was great and I would definitely go stay there again!
"The place was really good to stay. Felt just like home. The best part about this place is the location. It's near to the station and you have so many options for good restaurants. Definitely going to stay again. The Cleaner was so flexible, you can request her to come at your own convenience. Must book this place!!"

"Lovely, clean n cosy spot"
Convenient check-in and location.
"Host was very responsive, check in was an ease and place is clean."
Great as usual! 
Nice overall but not as what I expected
The place is really amazing !
"Place had really amazing natural lighting through the windows, although it's a little close to the road, so you would hear vehicles travelling and also would be able to hear people chatting as the place is above a few roadside shops. But their service is honestly the best I've got currently amongst most of the booking that I have made prior. "
Highly recommend this place! The rooftop was amazing during the day and night time. So close to everything and it was so clean! Thanks so much to the staff!
Wonderfully clean and good atmosphere. Very nice area.
"Comfortable and clean, but abit noisy cz stay with others people"
Good value for money.
"Located at Arab Street, a lot of wall art and very happening at night~ Hostel environment is exactly same as shown photo. Highly recommend for backpackers. Comfortable bed & clean environment, felt secure to stay ^0^"
Very close to eating place especially Zam Zam. I love this place and this is my 2nd stay. Definitely will come back again
Pretty clean place and in a convenient location. Pillows are nice and soft too. Easy check-in and friendly receptionist. It was a good experience.
Good
Clean! And the receptionist is very humble
One of the best hostels I ever tried extremly clean and comfortably ... great location location
"Very convenient and accessible location that__ very walkable and with tons of food and retail establishments nearby!

Despite its proximity to Haji Lane, I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet the room was at night (even on a weekend with a block party)

Only complaint was that one of the other dorm guests wouldn__ stop snoring haha! But that__ an obvious issue across all shared rooms!"
"Amazing location Walking distance to every thing food, MRT, laundry.
Friendly staff & helpful.
Clean, quite and new place."
Clean and nice place

Great place in a really good location. About 20 minutes walk to the city center with tones of places near by to eat and shop. Clean place with very friendly staff. Arrived around midnight and had full easy instructions on how to check in with no problems. Was dissapointed that there were no common areas or kitchen
Very clean good location helpful staff quite good WiFi can't complain really
"I like bed linens and a white big towel. Lighting above the bed and large storage underneath the beds. Good value and good location!!

Need to fix communication responsiveness!!  AirBnB communication was slow!!!!!!!!"
Wouldn__ refund a mistake
"Good value for money, good location, friendly and helpful people..."
Very clean and perfect location
Really good and cheap place for a 3 days stay in Singapore.
"Really nice, clean hostel in a great location in Kampong Glam. Great for enjoying the evenings on Haji Lane. The roof terrace is nice, but would be good to have a proper common area with a bit more seating. Staff are friendly and helpful."
Great location and very clean hostel. Comfortable and within walking distance of the metro. Would stay again.
Good
Nice place
Best hostel I've ever stayed. Rate it highly and recommend it :)
Really helpful staff! Getting settled here is a breeze
"I like the location because it__ near food shops, hospital, mall, and mrt."
"Not exactly a capsule hotel but more than adequate to spend a night. Very clean, unisex dorm style may not suit all but location is great and easy to get to nearest MRT Station. A surprising but pleasant experience and will repeat."
"Pros:
good location. 
clean. 
wifi good. 
sleeping conditional good.

con:
a proper space to dry clothes would be nice."

"Great value for the money. Cleanest hostel in the history of mankind. Simply, basic, and comfortable. Great location. Front desk is staffed from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. So, much easier to check in if arriving during these hours. Outside of these hours, a bit trickier, but possible. Would most definitely stay here again, and recommend it."

Cozy and perfect place to stay
Super clean place with very nice staff. The capsules aren't that noisy as people are quite respectful in general. I slept well in mine at least. Perfect location on Arab street. Very close to most of the main attractions. The only thing to note is that there are actually 2 beary best branches and they're all not too far from the Bugis station. So make sure you go to the right one.
"Clean hostel with reliable wifi and good and clean facilities in a beautiful neighbourhood of Singapore with lots of restaurants, cafes and shops around. Can totally recommend this place!"
Rooftop is a plus to enjoy at night time and city view. The place is very clean and well-organized.

Best toilet/shower I have ever gotten from a hostel. Do I need to say more?
Great Spot for a Visa Run!
Great location and comes with kit hen and utensils if u want to cook.
"Great location. Very close to the MRT (Farrer Park and Little India) and a 24-hr shopping mall (Mustafa). Apartment that we stayed in was slightly different from the pictures; there was no couch, and the TV was wall-mounted instead of being by on a table at the foot of the bed. Very near to restaurants. Overall, pleasant experience."
"Bella__ place has a great place, which is very close to MRT Station and bus stop, so you can easy to go anywhere to explore Singapore. The place is very close with 24hours shopping mall too,  Mustafa Center, you only need short walk to go there. 
The place was spacious, comfort  and clean with complete amenities. Enough for 3 or 4 person. Overall Bella__ place was  great. Highly recommended for traveller."
"Great location very close to MRT. Everything we can get from here like supermarket, food area. As a host  Bella was very responsive and accomodating. Recommended place to stay!"

Nice location and easy check-in. We had awesome time during the stay. We would like to stay once again :)
"Nice little spot. This was perfect for my quick stop through Singapore. Easy check in process, communication was fast and thorough. Thanks for a great stay!"
"The place is 3 minutes from Ferrar Park station. Little indian is near. Mustafa center, which you can buy everything with reasonable price, is 3-5 minutes walk fm the apartment. 
Thanks for providing the convenient place !"
"We were there for the U2 concert and it only took us a 10 mins drive to the national stadium. It was a pleasant stay, the housekeeper (Piju) was exceptionally helpful. The location is phenomenal with mustafa centre right smack behind the unit. Overall it was exactly what we imagined and enjoyed the hustle and bustle of little india. Thanks Bella & Piju!"
Super clean and nice! MRT super accessible which is really convenient
"Nice place near downtown, excellent for small family or couple"
"We stayed for 4 nights and it was an  stay! Bella was quick to reply to my queries prior to booking and even after the booking was sealed. Instructions for checkin and checkout were clearly provided. Checkin and checkout was smooth. The place was clean, quiet and very near Farrer Park MRT station so no problem going anywhere. Pooji made sure our needs are met during our stay. She was quick to replace the broken electric pot and missing blanket for the extra bed and constantly asked us what else do we need. Thanks for being a great host! Our Christmas was full of great memories of Singapore. "
"Bella is a great host. The rooms are super clean. You'll get all the amenities from nearby stores, supercool location."
"Actually this place was a strategic aprtment bcoz nearby Farrer Park MRT Station and nearby of Mustofa Market.

But, its difficult to find another food beside Indian & Turkies food...

Host, should be re-check the condition of bed and bathroom. Decoration in bed hurt my hand during my sleep and shower need to be replace with the new one because difficult to change from normal to hot water."
Small little apartment in the heart of little India. Convenient and very helpful hostess.
"This is my second unit I rent from Bella. I like the location, if you are into indian foods, they are everywhere. There is one shopping mall nearby and near to the infamous Mustafa Center."
"Very nice and comfortable place.  I stayed with my wife and kid for 6 nights. Nice location and a 3 min walk to Farrer park MRT, very close to mustafa center and other indian eateries. The caretaker cleans the place once every 2 days. The place has a small balcony too. Bella also responds timely. Great stay and just about good price. Thank you."
"Clean appartment, a bit noisy around"
"This place offers great location as it only needs short walks to Mustafa Centre, City Square Mall, 7-Eleven, Farrer Park Hospital/MRT station. Two thumbs up for the cleanliness, the room and all things are very clean. Lastly, it is accessible by online taxi as well."
"This place was very good to stay. Easy checkin and checkout. I could get a taxi easily there.
And Bella was very helpful and responsive."
Great place
"Bella's place was very well-maintained and clean. Unit was just like the pictures, with the supermarket a short walk away. Kitchen had clean and adequate utensils, and overall we had no problems at all with our stay!"
The place was great and check in was easy.response from host was fast.
Very responsive and understanding host. Highly recommended
Great place. Cosy. Sprakling clean
Bedroom space and toilet better then many 4* hotels
Air Condition was a bit weak! Overall a very nice place! And convenient!
Good and clean and value for money
"Convenient,quiet and well-cleaned apartment recommended:) surrounded with good foods and it is near the train station which takes about 5 mins walk to Farrer Park station:)"
Nice and clean place. Highly recommended.

"Two thumbs up!

Most importantly, the host Bella, is super accomodating. Of all the host I have encounteted she is the MOST friendly and you can tell she really cares about the satisfaction of her clients. Thank you Bella!"
"Bella__ place is as described and a fantastic value, especially those looking for on site parking, a rarity in Singapore. Great communication as well."
"I never meet the host before. I informed her before coming that I will be travel with family and will pay her for extension stay on 23rd not 21st as Fly plan changed. 
However maybe she didnt get clear what I said and only from the previous day before 21st she sent her cleaner up to tell me that We will need to check out the next day mean on 21st and pay for the extra people. ( the pay for extra people is okay as I already planned for that) however the bathroom smell bad when we check in even after the cleaner cleaned it.
The cleaner said she will bring an extra bedsheet, pillow and blanket for Us but it was never come. 
Three member of my family slept on the floor. One other slept on a single dirty look mattress cos no bedsheet cover. Luckily that we have spare travel blankets. But its all fine for Us as we all just out for whole day and only need a simple place to sleep.

The most hurt and sad thing is she literally gave Us very limit time to find a new place for 1,5 days left in Singapore. My nanny is 65 and My daughter is 2 years old we also have a lot more stuff from shopping plus our luggages. So the urgent move really stress Us out especially for my Aunty family who first time ever come to Singapore. This completely ruined our whole trip and the impression about Singapore. Really left Us feel like abandoned 
She told Airbnb case staff that her place was booked on the day I want and I didnt confirm her. 
Thats a lie! I checked few times after this and even on the day We moved she still has the similar or maybe even exactly the same one available.
She might just dont like Us its fine but wish she can just be nicer and tell Us a bit earlier.
However she seem very nice at beginning and help to tell her cleaner received delivery packages for me."
"The room is very nice, very very clean and comfortable! i really enjoyed my stay :) Bella was very nice and responsive. Location is great too. Definitely worth the money."
"I'm glad I found this place as I was traveling with my mom who was bedridden for a while with spinal cord issues and just beginning to step out after nearly 6 years. I wanted an apartment that would be close to the city (and a hospital just in case), have an elevator, shower (not bathtub), firm bed (matress was good), kitchen and of course safety. The cleanliness of the apartment deserves a special mention... It's super squeaky clean!! Annie seems to be a strict manager and ensures all is taken care of immediately! Location wise it's bang on with the hospital, metro, taxis, 24/7 food places, parks, all a hop, skip and jump away.
The laundry and balcony to dry clothes certainly helps. 
The kitchen is fully equipped but carry your own salt, pepper and tea. 
Building seems slightly oldish but the fittings are modern and brand new (and well maintained). Security is good with card access to the floors. 
Responses from Jayanti are super quick. 
It IS quite pricey but if you're weighing comfort, location and safety, go for it !"
Bella s place is very convenient clean and well equipped with amenities. It__ only few minutes walk from farer park mrt and Mustafa market. Tons of cheap and fresh eating places nearby. Overall clean and great place to stay.
Nice place. Will stay again if visiting SG
Great place! Very clean and spacious for 2
"Bella__ apartment is very comfy, clean and more than anything really well located (2 MTR are accessible by walk within 10 minutes) and the district Little India is also really enjoyable. We had a great stay"
"The apartment is easy to locate, just walking distance to City Square Mall which houses many shops, restaurants and supermarket. Though it__ in the busy Little India area, it is quiet at night after 10 pm. A cozy studio, great for couple."
"Very comfortable stay, super clean studio, and the balcony is a huge plus. Excellent location,  minutes walk to Farrer MRT station, Mustafa market, and city square mall. Definitely recommend!"
Good location. Right next to the little India area.  About 5 mins walk from MRT station.  Bella is very friendly and responsive.
"Highly recommended, great location!!"
"A very nice and cozy house! The house is clean and have everything you need. The location is also very convenient, just 2-3 mins walk to the MRT station.

Bella is very helpful and reply my message quickly. I especially like the housekeeping service! 

Only one small problem, the drains in bathroom have some bad smell. But I am sure Bella can handle it. 

Will definitely recommend this house to all my friends!"
Good location . Place is clean . Wonderful place
The location is quite convenience
"Located in geart of little India, I found the place conveniently located near MRT. You can easily get Indian food nearby, if you are looking for it. The place was clean and very comfortable for 3 people.

The host Bella is very helpful, easy to communicate to and always in touch.
She gave a homely feeling to us. She very generously allowed an early checkin and also helped us with our luggage after checkout. 
Will recommend this place if you want to stay in little india in a studio."
"The place  was better then I expected. Was about a 4 min walk to mtr which was perfect!! The apartment  was  clean, pretty spacious and the balcony had a pretty  nice  view too!! Bella was very helpful  and came to our needs immediately!!"
nice hosting and nice place to stay
Fast response and clean.  You wont regret.
"Bella is the kind of host you look forward to on airbnb. She is super fast in her responses, very kind & cooperative with our requests and she allowed us early checking._Her place was sparkling clean. She makes sure the maid comes every alternate day to clean up the place. Her apartment has all the amenities one would need for short & long term stay .The location of the apartment is great, close to multiple eateries_with lot of options to choose from and very walk-able distance from MRTs. Overall it was a great stay at Bella's and we would certainly prefer and recommend others to stay at her apartment."
"Bella__ Apartment is on the 5th floor with good views and in the great area of Little India. Lots of excellent restaurants and street food and local colour. Bed, bathroom and kitchenette are good, well appointed and clean. There__ also a nice little balcony. Air con was good. The lift was great for 5 of the 6 days I was there. I certainly don__ blame the host for the lift breaking down once. 
A lovely stay and a very responsive and helpful host."
"The studio house is clean and near to the MRT. The amenities inside are good. It is suitable for family stay. On the 1st day of stay, the aircon in my room is leaking water but Bella quickly response to us and get someone to fix and service the aircon the day after in the morning. ;))"
Bella's place is really great. The location is very close to the MRT station(s) and bus stop. It was super clean & complete. And bella is really just a message away. Everything went well. Will stay here again once i go to singapore.
sparkling clean & near to MRT
Location of apartments is very convenient from travelling point of view. Lots of Indian grocery shops and restaurants nearby. Bella's assistant was very helpful and cooperative. Bella was very responsive to queries.
"A cosy nice studio apartment in a lively neighborhood, close to the metro."
"Despite I booked the 5th floor, they gave me 2nd floor because of some malfunction air-condition problem which I forgot but no complaints because it's good too! Location is good, room is very clean and even a kitchen for you to cook! Will come back again in future"
Cool place in great location! Very quick response from host.
"This place is pretty good to stay at. Location was good. Not too far from a hawker center, MRT station, or 7Eleven and also pretty easy for Grab drivers to find and not stressful to get in and out of. The room was very clean and was as described. Overall I'd be willing to stay here again if I take another trip in Singapore."
"The place was great. Thanks bella for the quick responses. Great amenities, place was very clean and near to MRT station. Would love to come back again. Puja the housekeeper was friendly and nice too."
"It's very near to MRT station ,all the grocery and food outlets are walkable distance . It's great place with all the basic amenities . We were very happy and satisfied with the place"
Clean place. Host quick to respond with questions. Close access to nearby stores and restaurants.
"Quiet location and easy check-in, some Netflix channels.
Would stay again."
Die Unterkunft ist sehr gut gelegen. Das Apartment ist klein aber fein. Bella war stets erreichbar und sehr zuvorkommend!
"Nice and clean space, near little India, lively daytime yet quiet at night. Goid gateway to explore singapore, little tricky to connect to airport if u using mrt"
Quick response!
This was a great place to stay. I would recommend it.
Great condo and location. Will stay again if the need arises.
The host canceled this reservation 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
Friendly host
The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
"Great host. 
Location good.
Recommended."
Highly recommend! Host is very thoughtful and helpful. Location is perfect. I have a very pleasant and comfortable stay.
Good experience. RH did his best to meet my individual needs. Room was not that large but other things were good enough.
Awesome stay - thank u very much
RH and his wife are very nice people. There are here to help and share moment with you. I recommend
"My guests had a disappointing experience stay at this flat. It was misleading advertisement regarding sleeping arrangements, originally owner put 1 single bed & 1 couch, but couch wasn__ there, so my guests had difficulty to sleep for the first night there. They had to cancel the rest of their reservations."
Rh's place is small but very affordable in an otherwise extremely expensive city. Rh and his wife were very nice and responsive to our requests. Very kind hosts!
Todo tal y como hablÃ© con el anfitriÃ³n
"It is a quite small place, and no window in the bedroom. Best part of the experience is the hospitality."
"Great location, nice appartment and great people"
Cozy room with great hospitality in convenient location !   Worth for money.  RH and his wife are very friendly :)  I will definitely stay at their place when I travel to Singapore again.
Very good location and he is very nice person
I would recommend the place for anyone on a budget who wants a room to themselves close to the city center.
I had a good experience staying here.  It was at a very convenient location close to many good restaurants and shopping malls.  It was also close to many forms forms of public transport.  The host is kind and accommodating. It would have been nice if the room had better ventilation but the price is reasonable and good value.  I would recommend it for anyone on a budget who wants to have a room to themselves close to the city center.
"Above all it's a good place. But it's a very basic and it wasn't very clean. The bathroom is very little and it can be uncomfortable, I almost never saw the host , the space is a kind of independent from the rest of the house. Everything in Singapore is really expensive so maybe this place is good for the price, but I don't think I would stay here again."
"Great location and value. You get a single bed in your own air conditioned room and the owner is good with communication.

If you're expecting really pristine cleanliness though, this may not be the place for you. The shower is in the same area as the toilet (literally two feet away) and I came home once to a cockroach scuttling around in the common area.

However, it wasn't a big deal to me because I did feel safe and secure and at the time of booking it was worth the price."
"Great stay, thanks!"
"A wonderful place hosted by awesome hosts.  Vincent is a very friendly and quick respond host.
The location is so strategic which located 3mins away from Downtown MRT and 5mins from Raffles Place MRT.
There are lots of eateries around just as what described in the listing__ description. 
The unit is clean and comfortable. Me and my family having a great stay throughout the 3nights. We love the bay view from the observation sky deck. The night view is amazing.
I would highly recommend all of you to go for a stay and it is definitely worth the money!"
"I had a great stay over the weekend in Vincent's unit. The place is awesome. In location wise, it is so convenient and easy to access with MRT, buses and private transport.
The host is very nice and the unit is clean and tidy. We were happy with the complimentary food and beverages.
Will definitely stay again if we going to visit Singapore again in the future."
"Firstly, an awesome location to base yourself to get around Singapore. Two MRT__ nearby, Marina Bay on your doorstep, good gym and pool. Check-in process was simple and efficient. Very prompt communications."
Place is sparkling clean. The home has exact resemblance to the photo posted. It was much better than I've expected. Definitely value for money.

"The aircon broke down first night & took 24hrs to put in temp air cons, i was forced to checkin to a hotel, aircon repairman claims the aircon system is not designed to have all units working at the same time WTF!!!!!

The host was super friendly and very helpful, they gave us lots of information about the place itself and general information about tourist places and Singapore in general. Ask away and they will reply almost straight away.

We'll definitely stay here again if we're in Singapore and would recommend our friends to stay here as well. Overall, we have a wonderful stay."
Rien _ dire. Ce fut parfait du dÃ©but _ la fin.
"What an incredible place and location. We were greeted on time and escorted up to the place, where we found an incredible apartment with all the amenities. They even had snacks and water for us. Looking forward to booking this place again next year!!!"

"You get exactly what is advertised, we loved our stay. Please go through the home rules, there is a charge of SGD 100 for the loss of the access card, keep them safe :)
The host received us and they were very pleasant to interact with. This place is in the center of the downtown and very good for business travelers."
"The place is awesome! The condo is near the Downtown and Raffles Place MRT station. Basement of the apartment has shop for us to shopping.

At Central Business District, this place was quiet environment. At night walk few steps Marina Bay Sand is in front of me.

We reached the apartment midnight and tired with hungry. Extra touches Be My Home has provided (Snacks, water and...) with FOC. The bed and Aircon are new and gave me and my family sleep well.

I truly lovely this place. Definitely will book here when visit Singapore."
The apartment is in the financial district and very convenient for business travel. The host is great and very accommodating.
"Not only were the accommodation and location superb, if your budget allows,  then book this place. You will be very happy you did so. I miss it already. 
I will definitely come back to this fantastic place."

Vincent was very nice with our luggages, and providing tips on transportation. The condo has everything we need, nice and clean. The swimming pools, tennis court and gym are great but too bad we were so busy that did not have time to enjoy them. Will definitely recommend to my friends."
Very well positioned apartment in a friendly complex with lots of amenities.  Host was very communicative and ensured our stay was enjoyable.  Would recommend this apartment to visitors to Singapore

It__ very recommended and I definitely stay in this place again"
"The location is excellent! It is super convenient for getting around - for both public transit (MRT and buses) and taxis/grab. We also liked the layout of the space - the second bedroom has sliding glass doors that helped create a separate space at night for our kids but could be opened during the day to open the space up even more. The on-site amenities were also great - there__ a great view of Marina Bay Sands from the hot tub. Our young kids enjoyed the little playground and the several pool options (including a shallow pool they could safely play in).
Our host was flexible as our travel plans changed and was great at communicating with us before, during and after our stay to make sure we had everything we needed."
"I__ great to stay here, they are hospitality and quick response.
Very beautiful view at observation sky deck, especially 8pm light show.
Swimming pool very clean and relaxing.

"Great experience with this apartment and with the host!

The apartment is amazing.  It is in a great location of Singapore, close access to the financial district and to the top tourist attractions (Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, the Formula 1 circuit, the Singapore River, Boat Quay, etc.).  The building is great and has amazing amenities (pools, gym, etc.) . The apartment is very nice (two bedrooms, small dining room and living room, decent-sized and very well equipped kitchen, very good and reliable wifi, TV with basic local channels only).

Equally important, the host was amazing.  He was very responsive, quick to answer any questions before my trip to Singapore.  He picked me up at the airport and took me to the apartment for a very reasonable fee.  Sent me clear instructions on the apartment, and great advice on things to do and see in Singapore as well as basics nearby (restaurants and supermarkets).  He added a special touch by having free snacks and bottled water at the apartment).

Great experience!  I highly recommend this host and this apartment!"
"We loved it. Great location. Lovely home. Excellent facilities. And the host was extremely helpful. The view from the observation deck was spectacular. 
We (family with 4yo twins) were able to walk to heaps of attractions and found everything we needed at the unit. 
There was even a basket of food in the kitchen (noodles, biscuits, coffee etc) 
Highly recommended"

"This was an excellent stay!  The host was very accommodating and responded very quickly.  He even had tips on sites to see and places to eat.
The apartment is in a great location, near the financial sector and the Marina Bay Area as well as a popular hawkers market.
We had everything we needed in the apartment including extra treats and snack foods.  A thoughtful gesture!
The complex has a large gym and a beautiful pool and tennis courts.
Would definitely return to this host and his apartment."
"We had a very enjoyable stay.  The unit is in a spectacular location, close to everything!  Our host was very helpful and informative.  We requested airport pickup and he took great care with the details, even texting us the number of our luggage carousel at the airport!  The space is clean and modern and has everything you need.  Views from the sky terraces are breathtaking."
"Waking distance to the Marina Bay, Mail and casino"
"Great downtown location. Easy walk to anywhere in the downtown area. Easy access to MRT. 
Very quiet building, an upscale place to stay in Singapore. 
Fabulous host."
"The flat is wonderful.... nice host, nice location and beautiful flat. Really difficult to find better... I recommend it highly"
"Listing was spacious, stylish, clean and comfortable . I appreciated the water and snacks from the host. Very kind, friendly and helpful. Authentic hospitality.  Great location too."
"One of the best locations in Singapore...Vincent is a gracious host who attends to any questions/requests...the place if fabulous, comfortable beds more than adequate A/C plenty of hot water in both showers,open floor plan, incredible views, with amazing pools and incredibly easy access to the City by both MRT and Bus..would so recommend coming back here!"
"Quite convenient, many Hawkers around there.
Public space is messy & unclean. Thin wall brings me a noise, so easy to catch what they are chatting.
Reply from host is very prompt and polite. Cheaper than usual but more expensive than I felt."
"The building is friendly with AirBnB, even seems to against its rule."

Highly recommend for those who aim to go low cost travel in Singapore.
The host are very friendly and responsible.
Living environment is good.
The only thing is just the location is not walking distance from mrt, you need to take bus in order to get there.
Overall is good :)"
Very friendly host and supportive and flexible check in time!
"Nice owner, easy to find, coffee shop just under the block"
Nuzaibah is great with communication and an admirable host. Although I didn't get the chance to fulfil my trip i very much plan to meet Nuzaibah and enjoy Singapore
Nice place to stay
Very friendly host and allow full privacy
"A very cozy place, felt like home. Host was very kind and helpful, will answer any questions you ask while given useful informations. Highly recommended"
"Nancy is really friendly ! Perfect room, really cosy, in a sharing apartment with a nice little terrace.
Nice location close to the subway."
"The only disadvantage: the bedroom door lock is broken

"Nice decorated room, clean and comfortable bed. Bathroom is shared but a little dark to shave properly. Owner Nancy is so kind! :) Little off center, but connections with bus and MRT are frequent and fine!"
"Lovely and clean room,  just a few minutes away from a lot of great stuff! Nancy is a awesome host and very accessible. I really enjoyed my stay here."
"It was a compact place but amazingly decorated, prime location to go-to any sightseeing place in Singapore, plenty of eateries nearby, Nancy was very responsive throughout. Happy to visit again!"
"For three weeks I've stayed in this room to my great satisfaction. Although the room is close to the street I've had quiet nights of good sleep in this cozy room. The room is small, but comfortable, especially when you are alone. Airco works like a charm, and when you close the room-curtain, it doesn't even affect your sleep. The porch is very enjoyable to stay at too. Even though it is a dead-end street, there is still the possibility to see the daily life of Singaporeans (and the occasional Lamborghini ; ) going by the house, since there are two luxurious apartment buildings nearby. It's a nice and relaxing moment to sit in the swinging chair after a hard day of discovering all of Singapore's great highlights.  The house is situated on a good location, nearby a few big malls, and corner-kitchens, both at walking distance. The place is clean, and the facilities are comfortable to use. Enjoy your stay, and say hi to Nancy from me!

"Nancy's quaint little place near Farrer Park is a good place to use as your base when exploring Singapore. It's accessible and sits on a quiet little neighborhood. The room itself is very quaint. Especially loveed the wall mirror.

Best of all, however, is Nancy herself! She's very communicative and replies very promptly! It was such a joy to have her as our host!"

Nice room with good location also the owner is super nice!
"Nancy was very helpful - she was away during our trip but still very responsive and made sure that we got everything we need for the stay. The bedroom was small but nice and convenient, but there was some insect problems that could be taken care of. The shared bathroom was okay but need a bit more light and a shower curtain. The place is about 15 minutes away from the nearest MRT, but we preferred taking the bus as the bus station is closer and we ladies weren__ quite comfortable with walking late in the quiet, strange neighborhood."
Nancy has a great place which very close to 7 eleven & Ferrar Park MRT. It is situated in a quite neighborhood which is very peaceful. Shall be only staying there in my next trips to Singapore.
We enjoyed our stay! Place was charming and clean in a quiet neighborhood. Reasonably priced. The host responded right away to my last minute inquiries. Highly recommended.

Fair
Everything is okie
The place is amazing. Must check out
Nancy has been very responsive. Love the whole ethnic balinese vibe the place has to offer. Recommended for staycation!
This is a hotel. The location couldn__ be better. The staff is very friendly and the room was clean and comfortable. I__ stay there again.
The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.

"Pro: Great location(bus and mrt access). 20-25 minutes away from city central.Beautiful house in a lovely residential area. Pretty much had the first floor to myself . Mohan and Linda is very helpful and responsive .
Bedroom and attached bath for a good value.

Con: Sarah doesn__ response quickly . Room has a lingering smell. No direct sunlight nor ventilation. Next to the kitchen and you can hear kitchen and bathroom noise. Not good if you are a light sleeper ."
"Responsive, clean, punctual & easy going."
Sarah was very helpful as I asked her for an earlier check in. However the room is a bit old and dusty. It is a very good spot location wise and the area is very safe and quiet. The neighborhood is mostly made of independent villas and greenery so it's a lovely place.
"Really cosy home, and the helper Linda was really friendly and thoughtful! We had a great short stay :)"
Clean and quiet place to rest.

"We are in the process of relocating to Singapore. It was the perfect start of our stay in Singapore.Spent almost a month with my wife & our daughter at Alexis__ apartment. The apartment is super well located in Thiong Bahru (which is one of the most sought after localities in Singapore).

The apartment is just as can be seen in the pictures and is super clean and very tastefully done up. And Alexis is a perfect host, who is super quick in her response and very easy to communicate with.

Would definitely recommend to stay at her place

Thanks

Nikhil"
"It's a home just like your own. A cosy  place with designer touches and a mini 'library'. Food is practically easy, with cafes located at the ground floor."
Alexis is kind and always provides quick response which is really great! The location is near MRT station (about 5~8 min walk). The room is clean and big enough for 6 people to live in. Great choice if you want to visit Singapore as a tourist!
As good as I expected
"Alexis_ place is fantastic, and the pictures don__ fully do it justice. It__ in a fantastic location, really quiet but close enough to the action that it__ not dull. The apartment has everything you need for a short stay. Communication with Alexis was brilliant and he did everything possible to make our stay comfortable, he was particularly accommodating in getting us checked in when our daughter was sick."
Good location in the heart of real Singapore. Must try Cheng's for breakfast.
"Alexis's apartment is very clean and big enough for 4 of us.
All furnitures were cool. 
A big green couch and 2 beds were very comfy.
there were a lot of good restaurant s and cafes near by.
supermarket is also very close.
bus stops and MRT station were close enough.(about 5to8 minutes by foot.)
a nice relaxing park is just in front of the (Website hidden by Airbnb) went to the park almost everyday.

Alexis is very nice and helpful person.
She gives answers  very quickly and kindly.
I recommend you here.you will have great stay in Singapore."
___ ____ ì¢__ ì¢___´ì_
We stayed here for 3 days with no hassle. Check in was smooth and Alexis is always a message away to answer any questions. We like simplicity with lovely touches so this space definitely hits the spot. Decos are very tasteful. The place is clean and the shower is great. The bed and pillows are too hard for our liking but I guess that__ just our personal preference. The neighbourhood is lovely too and have tons of cafe and eateries nearby.  I would recommend this place if you__e in Singapore!
Alexis is a wonderful host. She replies very quickly to messages and is very accommodating. The apartment is very spacious and filled with light  everything you need is onle a short walk away. In fact great coffee (and carrot cake) is just at the end of the building. The outlook is very resentful across to the  park - we were lucky to see a lion dance minutes after checking in. We will definitely stay here again.
Great location in a quite but really nice part of Singapore hosts were great easy to get a hold of and explained very thing very well. Would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again

The apartment is easy to find in a lovely district with many little restaurants and the market around,good for u to enjoy the local life which also not far away from the city center!the room is cozy and clean!Highly commands"
"Nice experience, very close to Tiong Bahru Hawker Center"
Great place with a nice design except the glass door for the bathroom and the wifi is slow..
Alexis is really helpful and  responses our questions quickly. His apartment is located at a neighborhood where you are able to reach local market place and enjoy traditional food and culture easily.
"Very spacious for 4 people to stay. Only 2 big bath towels were provided to us when we checked in, which are not refreshed during the stay. But there is washer in the unit where you can wash the towels. Very  close to local market where all the good foods are at. It is about 10 mins walk to the nearest station. I found __rab_ to be more convenient considering we have 4 people in our group."
"The perfect stay! From the ideal location in Tiong Bahru (full of cafes, bookstores, and interesting history) to the stylish decor, I can't recommend Alexis' place enough. Really feels like a home. Tons of books for reading too! And a great view overlooking a park. Not to mention Alexis' amazing response time and kindness!"
Great space and location.
"Location is good.  The apartment is at a historical area.  It is close to a market, bus stops, and MTR.  It is across from a park.  Love the stay."
"Had an excellent stay with my small family including our 9 month old daughter, who enjoyed the view of the park out the bedside window each morning. The apartment looks just like it does in the pictures, with all the amenities that we needed, a good selection of books to pass time and tasteful decor. 

Tiong Bahru itself is a wonderful area to explore, with cafes, the local market, bookshops, small parks and photogenic alleys all within walking distance. Alexis was responsive to any communication and checked up on us when a neighbour informed of potentially noisy works that was briefly happening around the building. 

Only very minor issue was weak wifi signal inside the bedrooms, but that did not impact our experience. Will definitely be recommending this place to friends and family!"
å¥!
"We booked this apartment for family for a month-long stay. My relatives were very satisfied with the apartment and the amenities within. The location is great, the place is spacious, and it has everything they needed, including laundry (with a dryer!). Would definitely book it again if the chance arises!"
"Great location and very convenient, with lots of space for a family. An excellent choice for accommodation in Singapore."
"Super nice flat, the view is lovely, location is great! The flat is sparkling clean and the owner is super friendly. Strongly recommended :)"
"We loved our time at this apartment. It had everything you needed and was situated in the lovely suburb Tiong Bahru with its fantastic cafes, eateries, shops and market.  The apartment was stylish and well equipped. Our host was great and demonstrated excellent communication skills. We hope to return to Singapore in the future and would certainly stay in the apartment again."
I had a wonderful 3-week stay at this place. Highly recommended! =)
"We really enjoyed staying at Alexis's place while our apartment was made ready during the circuit breaker in 2020.  Got to know the area well, there are lots of lovely coffee shops and its opposite a nice park.  Things do occasionally go wrong when you stay somewhere long enough, but Alexis and her husband were always quick to respond - They were always there to help, which after some bad experiences, is worth a lot. Would be happy to return if needed or recommend to friends and family.  Strongly suggest you check out the local bakery and the area itself is full of cultural tidbits of info as its one of the first HDB developments I think.  Locals were nice and friendly also."
"Alexis's place is so lovely and has everything you need for a fantastic stay; the location could not be better right next to cafe's, restaurants, etc.,  it's over the street from a local park and has a lovely local area feel. The place has NetFlix and a Nespresso coffee maker and has two large windows you can open to enjoy the sights and sounds of the local area, Alexis is very friendly and quick to respond to any questions you may have - would recommend this place for cost and size."
Wonderful base for a visit to Singapore. Location is awesome. Lots of food around. The place is functional and has some interesting touches.
A good location and worth the value
Overall our first glamping experience was great. The host Sarah  was very responsive and flexible with our requests. The tent was really stylish and accurate as to what the host mentioned. Will definitely book again for our future events.
"My kids ( 3 and 5 yo ) had a great time! The tent was prettily done up and comfortable. We slept really well and enjoyed ourselves. 

Special thanks to Sarah and her team for taking the time to change the wet rug ( due to heavy rains during check-in ) and replace the mattress. 

My kids and I were fascinated that there was a fan in the tent too. Haha! 

We will definitely rent it again and recommend to my friends!"
"Sarah is very responsive in the questions we sent her and she will try to cater to our needs. The space is very private and near it__ near bbq pit. We had an enjoyable picnic under the stars. It would be more fun to go as a group and I think couple can be quite boring. Nothing much to explore and I would advice bring picnic mat and games, the sand is clean and soft. You should wake up early for sunrise. Toilet is near and Carpark g is just behind."
Thank you for accommodating to our request to set the tent at another location! Providing photos for us when the set-up was done to put our minds at east!
"Firstly, Im thankful to Sarah & Haziq for accomodating us as we booked only 12 hours prior to check-in. 

You can only get to the meet up location if you drive or Grab there but the check-in was fuss free. Haziq unzipped the tent and voila, we were all set for the weekend. Our tent was right at the end of the nook - overlooking the sea & sailing jetty. 

He upgraded us to a jumbo tent with 4 queen sized beds & heaps of pillows. The tent also came with 2 fans, a small teepee you can't do anything with, two battery operated fans, a cooler box, a small table, two battery operated candles & two outdoor chairs. 

We brought our own outdoor mat so it was nice to chill outside. In fact, we were outside most of th time, enjoying the sea breeze. 

It gets realllly warm in th tent during th day / the next morning so we opened all the smaller window inserts. The fan was blowing hot air like how it is in the summer so we didn't really bother much about it. 

At night, a group of about ten enthusiatic 50 somethings & their young kids camped next us. They looked like they are there every weekend to fish. They didnt really have tents, just individual chairs & outdoor mats. They play really good music too so we got a free DJ & it spared our speakers battery.

The crowd from the BBQ pits / other tents nearby doesnt really bother us too. Everyone was just chilling & enjoying nature it seems.

There is a fair bit of choice food wise on Food Panda / Deliveroo. We identified ourselves with the BBQ pit number behind us so that was easy peasy as well.

Our only other gripe other than th heat (which comes with any outdoor activity in Singapore anyway) was the toilet! Oh man, since it is a public toilet - the smell was insane. We found a way around it by using the slightly cleaner handicapped toilet, which we take turns to splash with plenty of water - pay it forward. Tissue paper was aplenty. If you plan to shower, the outdoor faucets don't really provide any privacy but there is one indoor shower stall which we take turns to use. You just have to shower once at night and first thing in th morning to cool down or you will just sweat all your glands out. 

Overall - it was an interesting experience for our party as we have never really camped out before. The tent was glam for sure, everything else - just remind yourself that you are in it to be outdoors anyway. Will definitely rebook once the haze period is over."
Location near toilet which is very convenient. Nice fishing spot. It will be much better if you have two fan inside the very spacious tent and check the battery level to make sure it works well. Ice cooler box and mineral water is provided. The air mattress is a bit too soft maybe can add more air to make it firmer. Good thing our tent was saved from the sun heat since it was under a tree. Overall good camping experience. Thank you.
"View was great, host was friendly.. a great experience overall"
"Thoroughly check the location of the place, there__ not much food places in the areas you__l have to walk to the other side of the place to see little restaurants around 4 of them. If not then you__l have to walk much farther. There__ no convenience store near by other than the small store beside the place. Prepare to walk a lot and change couple of lines of the train to go to the famous tourist spots. The room also have bad WiFi signal so we had to stay in the dining room to connect. The place looks like the picture so don__ get your hopes up, what you paid for is what you__l get."
"The place is perfect and close to mrt , the host is very cooperative!!"
"Place was still being set up when I stayed. No WiFi, tv, or stove use. Overall a good stay otherwise."
A good place to stay with small family
"I stayed at this place for 11 days and writing a review is difficult because I've stayed in many 5 star airbnb places.

The kitchen has all basic needs, silverware, plates, pots, etc. But was missing wine glasses and corkscrew. However, as a westerner in Asia, I wasn't expecting this since its not standard in Asia. It did have a rice cooker and microwave though.

Even tho apt is updated, building is bit older which imo gives it character. I love old buildings and unique places. It was quite cute and lovely, but with that it has its imperfections to admire. So I wouldn't expect a brand new luxury place.

There is no lift, but check-in and check out was super easy and hassle free. The bathroom was very clean and towels were nice. I especially appreciate the water pressure which is good.

Farrer Park MRT(purple line) is a 7 min walk.

I only deducted one star due to the place of worship right outside of the window. It doesn't disturb me personally, but for some it may. I could hear them around 7am, noon, and 8pm. If you don't plan on being there much then it shouldn't bother.

The bed is quite comfy compared to others I've stayed in Singapore which was relieving. Overall, it was a great and positive experience. No complaints."
"we had a great time at this space, I was traveling with my parents, they loved it also as this place is covered with temples .This is nearly 8-10 mins walk from Farrer park mrt. convinent,clean and perfect . would highly recommend."
"Great place for a family of 4.  Well furnished with all necessary cooking utensils and all amenities required inclyding wifi, iron.  Wel connected to anyway in Singapore.  700 meters MRT, 200 meters  Bus Lines, 600 meters city centre mall, 500 meters so many food places, whatever cusine."
This place is just perfect for 3 people. It's easily accessible and very close to the MRT station. I would highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a comfortable Airbnb for a couple of days.
"Aaron and his team are easy to communicate. Easy check in and check out. Place is comfortable for 3 people. They provided anything that you need like the power adaptor, blower, iron and things for cooking. If you are a light sleeper, the sounds from the surrounding temples will bother you. If you don't mind the noise, the place is just perfect."
"Nice  apartment, only a short walk to MRT, malls etc. The space is very comfortable and is ideal for a  visit."
Satisfied
"Clean, well furnished unit in a convenient location. Had a great stay."
"Very convinient location and responsive host, I recommend"
Had a good stay at the apartment
Such a great place to stayed
"BAD SERVICE AND HYGIENE, when we first check in we found the remote was faulty and we waited from 3p.m. till around 7 or 8 p.m. for them to send us a new remote and there wasn't any fan available for us and the place was very dusty... HIGHLY DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE."
"Le studio convient _ une petite famille. Nous Ã©tions 2 adultes et un enfant.
Nous avions apprÃ©ciÃ© la proximitÃ© du mÃ©tro.
La location est propre et surtout climatisÃ©e."
"Cozy apartment as described with almost everything you need to make your stay comfortable. Do keep in mind that you need to walk up staircase to the apartment on 3rd floor, which might be a bit troubled should you have heavy luggages.

Good location and easy to get around Singapore as near bus stop, walkable to 2 MRT station and City Square Mall (with supermarket, shops and restaurants). Quiet and peaceful neighborhood. 

The staff - Kevin was helpful and quick in response via (Hidden by Airbnb) .

All in all, we really enjoyed our stay and definitely recommend this place for group of 2-3 pax."
ok
"It's a totally a great place to stay when you are visiting Singapore, the place is just few minutes walking distance from the MRT station. Spacious flat, with all the facilities you need the most. Surrounded by chill and calm area. A little bit noise  when we stayed there at night because another guest who stayed above our unit kept walking around in their unit while it gave a bit noise when we tried to sleep.

But overall, it's super comfy and affordable place to stay. I woupd lovely to recommend to stay in this place. Thanks!"
"Very nice and clean place to stay, I recommend this place to all other travellers."
good and comfortable place to stay
"Brilliant location on the edge of Little India - with many eateries and great coffee places within walking distance. 
The apartment is a great size if you__e a single person or a couple, plenty of room and storage to spread out and has a great view of the east.
Thanks for having us!"
"Location is great and the room is very good, definitely will book again"
It was a decent place. The place would be much better if it were tidier. P
"The worst accommodation experience ever.
 First of all the title of the listing is not right, as the house is not a heritage place but another attached building. 
Very heavy smell starts form the entrance of the building, welcomes you inside the flat. Flat itself is stinky.  if you leave any food around for a minute, ants will be joining you at the place. The bed is not the same as in the photos. 
Windows are facing temple and chanting starts in the morning and continues all day along."
Overall clean and has good water pressure. Good place to stay if you have a small family.
"Aaron's place is located conveniently off serangoon road near the historc Little India district so you are in the middle of a cultural metling pot and culinary oasis. Also a stones through from balastair road where you can try the excellent chicken rice of boon tong kee / loy kee.  Well connected just oposite Boon Keng MRT and many bus roots. Place is quite, wifi works well, inside its neat, tidy stylish and comfortable. Great communication, flawless check in / out."
"This place is on 4th floor, all stairs which was not mentioned by host. It was a good exercise with luggage to carry up to four floors. Mouse were roaming in the flat and owner was not responding. This is kind of studio flat where kitchen and bed in the same area. Bare bone, we couldn__ get even salt and sugar in the kitchen. I won__ recommend this place to anyone, specially family 

Vivek"
Nice location and great space
Very nice place ! Thank you very much _ºï_
It was good .. will miss the place .. my friend cried before we left

Amenities were well provided too! 

Would recommend for a nice experience with family or friends"
It__ a great experience and the glamping location is really awesome . Host is super accommodating and responsive too :)
Sarah & Hafiq are the best. Great GLAMPING time at ECP. Must experience.

"It was a waste of money. Was nothing at all like the Pictures. There was Dirt inside the tent. The carpet inside had a Red Stain. Had No heart light from the picture . Had No lights in front of the tent from the picture. There were No Chairs infront of the tent like in the picture. The inflatable matresses were very bouncy and not totally inflated. The provided Fan kept disconnecting and dying, and it's hot inside the tent. And since the there were not much features in the tent, it was very empty. For 180, it is not worth at all. A staycay elsewhere is much better. You'll get an Outlet to charge and a private bathroom. Sorry to give a bad review. But you know what you did was wrong.."
They can always expect the unexpected as every new set up will come in new decos. Hafiq and sarah are good in what they do.

Great location. Right on top of fantastic food and the MRT.
great location
Great for dogs
We enjoyed our stay. The staff was very friendly and the location was great. We will definitely be back.
"The one bed was way too small so we asked to upgrade to the premium one bed - they told us they had it but when they did not have on the day we were supposed to move, they upgraded us to A 2 bed - great hosts - I have stayed before and when I come back, will likely stay again - great location as well"
"Great apartment at a very good central location. Walking distance to orchard road and the famous Mohammad Sultan road and Robertson Quay. Enjoyed my stay in general. The apartment was well decorated, and because I was upgraded to 2 bedder, my apartment was quite spacious. The only downside was that it doesn__ come with proper kitchen setup. Only an electronic stove was provided and not suitable to stir fly and cook anything that smells as the fumes would consume your apartment. There is no exhaust fan in the kitchen.  Also would be great if chopsticks and a pair of scrissora could be found in the kitchen drawer."
"Convenient clean and friendly, recommended"
We had to cancel due to some miscommunication. The Airbnb app was lagging badly. He assisted me to get my refund. Although I did not get to stay at his place this time. His hospitable personality would definitely make me book again when the chance arises.
"I enjoyed staying at Thanksgiving! It's good value for money. Within walking distance you can find many restaurants, bars, supermarkets and malls. The staff was really helpful and responded quick to requests. The pool and gym were a bit basic, but it all was in good condition. Downstairs you can find a big table to work on which is really convenient. Overall experience was good and I would book here again!"
Stylish and big room with a convenient location to central! Can definitely recommend for a stay.
"The room was much better than I expected. The pictures don't do it justice. Giulia and Pav were really kind to me and they gave me lots of tips on where to eat in the city center. Also, Giulia welcomed me with some salami and cheese, since she knew I was Italian like her. It was a great surprise and I felt at home straight away!"
"Great place! Seems far away from the center on the map, but it really isn__ since it__ close to a metro. Super nice facilities and hosts."
"It was such a wonderful 5-day stay at your house  
The accommodation is beyond our expectation and so comfortable. Many thanks to Pav and Gulia for everything!!!"
Future travelers can expect great hospitality and friendly conversation. Overall an excellent stay.
"The place is good, clean, very spacious and decently connected with public transport. Guilia and Pav are good hosts. They made the stay comfortable by constantly being in touch."
"Perfect location, spacious apartment and outstanding service. I can definitely recommend staying here and will certainly stay with Jay again in the future should my travels bring me back to Singapore."
"Good place to stay at in Tanjong Pagar. Very good location. Pool is and jacuzzi are nice.
We had a good time here. The replaced the TV for us as when we arrived the existing one was broken."
Very good experience.Will be back again.
Very well-furnished downtown hotel with nice staff. Much better than I expected. I will book again next time I visit Singapore.

Unit is located right in the center of Chinatown. Very convenient.
"Exactly as I expected from the descriptions. 

The room is a bit small so if you're traveling w/ more than 2 adults, I would look elsewhere. 

I saw housekeeping cleaning the other rooms and they were super diligent and definitely scrubbed every crevice. Rest assured that your room is thoroughly cleaned. They do use a super strong scent freshener in the room, so be prepared for that when you check-in.  Also thoroughly appreciate the free water! 

The beds were super comfy and the water pressure in the shower was very nice. I would recommend you take a quick shower though since the hot water tank is fairly small. 

A++ location. Just a quick 3 minute walk to the Metro + a plethora of food options right at your door step. Hotel 1888 is literally right around the corner from the Chinatown Hawker Center!"
Very easy check-in and clean space!
Good location. Staff are nice and friendly.
"Superb location in heart of Chinatown and easy reach of Marina Bay Sands, Raffles etc. Very helpful front desk who are there 24/7 and booked us cabs (which were very reasonable) when needed."
Fantastic location right in the heart of Chinatown. Everything as described. Small and generally neat and tidy but the size was expected.

"The hotel is great, the room is clean and neat. I like the idea of using projector, it's like watching mini theater. The location is in Chinatown which is a great thing because there is so much in Chinatown such as delicious food, gift shop, and many more. It is also a less than one minute walk to the nearest MRT station. A perfect place to stay in Singapore."
"Great location, good accommodation, good value for money in one of the world's more expensive cities."

"We really enjoyed our stay here, beds are super comfy and the projector is nice to have. The rooms weren__ unbearably small but we were in a triple for the two of us. We loved it here and it__ very central"
"Good place and service. Located in Chinatown is very convenient for shopping, eating, traveling, and etc. Just one thing, the wifi didn't quite work."
"I'm always weary about staying in places in Chinatown but since it's Singapore, I figured it's pretty safe. Staying at Peter's place/hotel was awesome (we stayed 2 days). Staff was pleasant. Hotel was easily accessible from the MRT/train/subway to and from the airport and tourists attractions. The Chinatown MRT station is literally just a block from the hotel and about 2 blocks (2-3mins walk) to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and the Chinatown Complex for some cheap, local food. It's also about a 5 minute walk to the Maxwell food centre, which is another place to grab some cheap and local food (definitely recommend!!! lots of stalls to choose from, open early and closes late). Chinatown is also prime for some cheap souvenirs so don't buy those $8 magnets at Merlion Park or Gardens by the Bay because you'll see the same ones for $1-2 (same with keychains). 

With regards to the hotel and the room, it was clean upon arrival and they provide everyday cleaning and changed towels/sheets everyday (you see their housekeeping cart every morning and your towels changed when you come back). They also replenish water, coffee and tea that the room initially comes with. They also provide other amenities including teapot, fridge, safe, slippers, toothbrush, lotion, shampoo/conditioner, hair dryer, bath gel (soap?), and projector tv with cable. The room also includes an AC. Many complains about the AC not being cold, and it does take a while to get cold right after you turn it on (since the keycard is the one providing power, you can't leave it on all day). But I learned that if you set it lower than what's originally set, it gets colder faster, and it does get cold if it's turned on overnight, so that wasn't that big of a deal. 

We stayed in a triple room (1 queen/full bed and 1 twin), and the room is small in comparison to typical hotel rooms, but it's better than staying in a hostel where you have to share a bathroom. We didn't have big luggages, only backpacks so the size was fine for us and cozy. The room is very techy and cool, especially the bathroom's atomized glass! It was raining on and off when we were there so they also provided umbrellas for folks to use. 

Overall, it was a great place to stay in 2 days and well worth for the location and cleanliness and amenities provided. Would definitely stay here again and recommendable."
Fantastic place to stay in the middle of Chinatown. The hotel is easy to use although rooms are compact. Very easy to get there from the airport on the MRT. They kindly allowed us to leave our bags by reception before check-in and after check-out.
Great location (near Chinatown MRT) & nice stylish rooms.
"I would stay at this hotel again because I loved the idea of using projector instead of an actual TV. Guests can connect their own devices (iPad/iPhone/Laptops) to the projector (must bring your own HDMI cables). I also loved the platform bed and how it was able to accommodate to an odd number of people without the third person being left out. The smart toilet is also innovative as this is my first time using it. The place is very near Chinatown MRT which is very good as it was easy for us to travel taking the trains. But other than that, the wifi of the hotel needs to be fixed (it wasn__ working at all, even when it was connected, we could not load anything). The toilets also need a little bit more servicing as there were flies coming out from the drain. Aircon wasn__ working so well. But I still enjoyed the stay. Thank you."
Very satisfied.
Nice location and nice room. Will come back soon

"Space is something that you can expect and it is great having that kind of space with the price in Singapore. However, do expect the hostel type hallway while entering your room as well as the cleanliness needs some improvement."
"Jun is very helpful and responsible in meeting our needs.  Great location-easy access to public transport, Whampoa hawker center (good foods at reasonable prices) and NTUC supermarket."
Everything is exactly what you see in the photo. Easy check in and check out.
Thumb up!
Good stay relaxed location near a great hawker centre
"Old and dirty. Too expensive for the facilities. 
Not worthy 60 dollars at all. More like a 40 dollar place price.

No living room space, very few windows. Not a cozy place.
Quite dirty and messy, with boxes, bags, clothes and things from other people hanging around. Bad smell from previous guests in the room. Bathroom not clean, with clogged sink."
"Great place. Common areas are quite messy, but the room is clean overall. Amenities are good. Best points: 1) there are a few good eateries around, 2) a bus stop very close by. Easy connectivity, safe location."

"Hosts are nice and communicated well. A co-host took me for a 10min tour to point out restaurants, market, grocery stores near by and explain bus routes, which was very courteous. 

Outside the room the place isn't as neat or organised as you would expect from an AirBnB. Room has window and isn't insulated, as it's close to a road sometimes there is noise so if you are a light sleeper like me perhaps look for another place. 

I paid around $37/night and stayed 3 nights, I feel that was pricey for the place and $25/night would be more of a justifiable cost per night."

The apartment unit is well kept n clean. Very suitable for couple.
Always available to respond to ur query.  A great host.  Thanks again Kaurus
Worth to rent but the room quite small and common room/shower room only cleaned once a week
The whole staying experience is good except for the noise level at night expected with the room located along the main road. A good variety of food all around and is quite central to travel around.

"Our stay at this property was average. Upon arrival, we were told our room was not available and we were relocated for the first night (however, we were reimbursed for the price difference).

We enjoyed our stay here solely due to the location of the property, as it was easy to access to the MRT. 

However, several things could be improved i.e. more power sockets, more towels and better amenities. The internet and overall phone signal was very poor."
"The room was exactly like the photo and everything, but I had pretty bad issues with communication with your main staff and during the cancellation of this stay(due to my personal unsatisfactory experiences)."
"The apartement was located very central. Orchard Road can be reached after 10-15min walking. The next MRT station Fort Canning is 10min walking apart. Everything could be reached very quickly. The apartement was clean but the door and bathroom looked a bit used.   All in all, we had a pleasant stay at Rcs apartement."
"Reasonable location, you need to download the Grab app should you want easy Taxi pick up and drop off. (Certainly a great way to get around)
Basic accommodation, clean, and AC works well. 
Host pleasant but not forthcoming with information on grocery stores, street maps,  local walks etc unless specifically asked. Certainly he responded quickly to issues and was attentive to concerns."
"Very good location,very close to the orchard"
Very clean modern spacious
"nice place, big place, comfy for kids"
"expect no basic necessities, toilet rolls, soap, tea towels, tea coffee sugar, salt, washing powder etc. We booked for 4 and got a double and a single bed, A mattress was thrown on the floor which meant the door to the bedroom couldn't open even half way. Then told if anyone asks say we are staying for three months as they aren't allowed short term accommodation.  Very over priced for a barely 2 star accommodation."
The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
"Near to orchard road,walking around 10-15mnt"
"At first, we didn't. get the room we booked cuz there was some maintenance problems with our room. The owner gave us another room which wasn't ok at first. Told the owner about our situation and they give us another room , which was really great for us to stay. The rooms are clean, spacious and the amenities provided are quite useful as well. Overall, our family is satisfied with the stay."
The pictures make it look better than it really is. The couch has some strange sketchy looking stains.
"The apartment was comfortable and clean. Check-in was easy, with someone coming super quickly after calling a phone number given in advance. The apartment is located in a rather quiet and residential area, but there are some good cafes and restaurants nearby as well."
Clean. Close to everything. Great communication from Host.
Perfect
"Had a comfortable 2nights stay in Ong's appartment. Good location, about 10min walk from Orchard. We could also leave our bags on the last day and get them hours after the checkout, this is very practical for anyone wanting to explore the city without the pain of luggages."
"Great place, no fuss, no broken glass, I was practically in a penthouse"
"Location is easily accessible, very close to public transport and central to most shopping centres by foot. The place is clean, although the studio setting was a little strange - there was no curtains/blinds at the pantry close to the bedroom. Overall, it was clean and very comfortable for 2 people."
Great place
Excellent walking location from Orchard road. Clean and space-sufficient apartment. Superb staff.
"Very helpful, very quick to respond, this was good.  Nice people.
The lock on the balcony door could be better, if felt torn and I could shake the door open. I did not feel safe to sleep in the bedroom. The same with the lock to the apartment stairs in the middle of the apartment layout. I slept in the living room. The sheets for bed did not fit the comforter it was put in and could have been a little better."
everything was good..this is my first experience with airbnb.
"Very tidy place. Just the kitchen area and the e trance to the unit are too narrow.  Have to watch out of steps.  Otherwise, location is good. Clean place, nice shower and toilet plus laundry is great. Bed is just a double-bed size."
Nice comfortable cosy place to stay in with very nearby 24:hr Ntuc
nice place to stay
Nice and cozy place!
"Construction near by when i was staying there, it vibrates the bed when i__ lying down but doesn__ affect anything else"
Very spacious and clean. Looking forward to coming back here.
The stay was good and cosy
"Check-in was a little confusing, the building staff was rude about it too. The pathway got a little narrow towards the bedroom but overall the apartment is really nice! Good location too, it__ about a 10-15 min walk to orchard central and Somerset 313!"
the place was okay not really to my expectation.
"__¸¸æ»¡æ_,_å¹²å____"
"Ong and her team was responsive and helpful despite miscommunications. The airbnb contact point was apologetic and provided good customer service. However, we feel the need to be transparent and honest in our review. 

1. One of us stepped on a small piece of glass near the kitchen area and her foot bled a little. Since then, we wore our slippers throughout the stay. 

2. Air con in the living room was dripping water onto the TV and electrical power extension bar which seemed like a safety hazard. We informed the host.

3. The next day, 2 male workers entered into the apartment unannounced with another set of keys. We were in the bedroom and could not hear the knocking, given that it was a corridor distance away.  We did not give prior consent for them to come over at that time, or to enter the apartment even if we are not in. A text from the owner to give heads-up would have been ideal. 

3. Building construction works directly outside the apartment, so expect noise from morning to evening. 

4. Sofa couch was dirty looking with stains and some hair. We requested for sheets to cover over it and a man came over with towels."
Overall it was ok
really beautiful place!! well spent anniversary :)

"Small clean room good for single travelers. Bed was very comfortable, but was a bit loud at night from the noise outside."
The room is small as expected like most places in Singapore. Construction noise was kind of a disturbance and it can get pretty noisy also because the businesses around. The bed is super comfy and the room is clean. The MRT station is pretty near so its convenient to travel around.
Affordable stay. Great host!
Room was abit dirty but great service and amenities was good overall
Definitely recommended.
Great location in the centre of China Town and their staff were hospitable and nice. But the room was a bit smaller than what I imagined from the pictures.
Good for the price
"Some room for improvements: Too noisy at night as we can hear children playing outside the walkway, adults talking loudly,  air-con leaking inside the room and the hotel is hard to look for."
Overall a better stay than I expected. The location was great; walking distance to MRT and Chinatown. Lots of food and shopping in the area. I__l def stay again.
"Love this cozy place, room is clean, location nearby mrt and downstairs a lots restaurant."
"Nice place to stay in, just that it is not sound proof, little bumps from the neighbour rooms and the cleaners cleaning up the rooms are very noisy."
The place was much better than i expected and its really unique!
"Had a very pleasant stay! Rooms are small  but it's enough for a comfort stay. Room is clean, there's water/ tea provided. Small mini fridge in room as well. The projector and tv box is not really useful as you have to pay for the shows. But i really enjoyed my stay there, very value for money! Short walk away from the MRT. The entrance is not easy to find but overall still Recommended."
"Central location, the bed is super comfy. Great service. Thank you."
"good location ,good service!"
Nice and fun area but the room looks a lot smaller than expectation. Very friendly staffs tho.
Everything was fine.Will be stay here again when next visit.

As marketed.
Great location
"Ideal location for anyone new to Singapore as you are right in the centre of the action! The room is super clean and cosy, perfect for a couple. After a long flight we slept so well and could not recommend the chilli crab In the market next door any more!!"
Check in is on the second floor.
"The 1888 hotel is located right in the middle of Chinatown.

The hotel has very thin walls so it's quite noisy sometimes, and as the bathroom is right there in the bedroom it's not very private.
However the staff is very nice and helpfull, the location is great and the bed is super comfortable.
So for those looking for a stay in Chinatown I would recommend it as a decent option."
Decent but small for the price. Someone brought a durian in the hallway and it was quite stinky.
Pretty good. Good location in Chinatown. The metro is great but I used the buses more because they are above ground (except for going to the airport).

Best location! There are lots of local good food around. Room is a bit small but with everything you need. Nice place!
"If you__l only be at this listing to shower and sleep you__l probably be fine, but please bear in mind that there are no windows and it__ a very tiny room."
This hotel is very clean and in an excellent location in the heart of Chinatown. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The only issue I had was the room I was given was smaller than I had understood from the photos and had no windows which would be okay for me for 1-2 nights but not longer. I had originally booked 7 nights but only stayed 1 night.

"All great just need a more touch up on the entrance area. Will come back probably, with a lower price paid on 1st stay"
"Wonderful place for a quick layover in Singapore. Great location, super clean and the bed was surprisingly very comfortable."
"Price was too high for what you get, room was very small but was okay, luckily only there for two nights, wouldn__ want to stay here for any longer, no window or natural lighting,  very cramped rooms. Shower and toilet all working fine no issues, but literally at the bottom of the bed. 
Ok for passing through but not recommended long stay "
"Prima plek, moderne kamers, maar ik raad je aan te vragen naar een kamer met raam. Anders heb je echt het gevoel in een bezemkast te slapen. Locatie top, personeel vriendelijk."
The location was right near the Chinatown MRT which was nice. The room is super small and quite claustrophobic. But the AC worked great. Bed was comfy. No privacy for the toilet though.

"We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel 1888.  Rooms were as expected, very clean and had many small amenities.  The staff were very helpful and gave great recommendations. For us the best part was definitely the location, which was only a 3 minute walk from the Chinatown MRT. Simple and easy, definitely will be staying again in the future."
"Die Unterkunft liegt im Herzen von Chinatown. Es ist alles sehr gut erreichbar. Egal ob zu Fu_, mit der MRT oder mit dem Bus. 
Das Zimmer ist ein klassisches Stadtzimmer ohne Fenster. Reicht aus fÃ¼r eine _bernachtung. Leider hat bei uns die ganze Nacht der Abfluss gegluckert, sodass wir eine relativ schlaflose Nacht hatten."
"The location of this place was amazing! Just down the street from the MRT and right in the heart of Chinatown, so it was easy to get around and easy to find food very close. My only __omplaint_ is that the room was sooooo tiny, we could hardly even lay our two suitcases on the ground at the same time! Which I don__ think was accurately conveyed in the photos. Once we were in bed we didn__ notice the space, but I think it might be difficult to stay here more than a night or two. Not a big deal though, we enjoyed our stay nonetheless"
Would recommend.
Location is fantastic. Room was good but small. Loved the projector tv!
"This was a great place to stay during our short visit to Singapore! It__ comfortable, close to an MRT station, and the host was very helpful!"
"Friendly staff and great location in china town. Great room for one person, but if you are two you will be walking over each other. When using the bathroom you will be 50 cm from your partner, with only a glass wall separating you from them."
"The rooms were exactly as described and as the other reviews state. 

The location was amazing. Right in the heart of Chinatown. The rooms are tiny and have no windows. We weren__ unhappy, we knew what we were getting when we paid for it and it was as described. 

Definitely recommend based on price and location. If you need a room with space, this isn__ for you."
"Exceptional location, heart of Chinatown. The room was clean, a bit tiny but fit well for us( a couple). The staffs were helpful, they lend us umbrella and helped us with MTA train. Walking distance to China complex food court which was amazing about food. If you are foodie like us, staying in Peter__ place will be a great choice; you will have access to all Singapore traditional foods within a mile from this location"
"This place will do. The staff were lovely, the room was clean (except a few hairs in the bathroom), extremely comfortable bed. We stayed here for 8 nights and it was more than enough room for 2 people. Loved it and it__ the perfect location!"
"A great place for a staycation, cozy and have everything you need."
"The location is in the middle of China town and is very convenient. There is an MRT close by. The room is small but has everything you need, bed toilet and shower. The TV is a giant projected screen which is very cool."
good
"Perfectly located hotel, right in the heart of Chinatown 
Nice room 
Helpful staff"
"Just stayed for one night, but I had the best sleep ever for a budget hotel"
"Hotel 1888 Collection is the hotel to choose for your stay in Singapore! Conveniently situated in Chinatown and 2-mins away from Chinatown MRT, the location is perfection. In terms of reception, I was greeted by a nice lobby, looking better than the photos itself. The room was unique and provided enough space for me. Overall, I 10/10 would recommend and definitely will come back!"
Great place to stay at! Close to Chinatown MRT Station.
"The room I got had a loud compressor (or old a/c) which made extreme noise. Host promised to fix that issue in a few hours, but at the end I was forced to look for another hotel at midnight."
"Very conveniently located, simple but stylish, very helpful staff. I had a pleasant and comfortable stay."
Good location and stylish design
I stayed in this place for one night traveling to Australia. I had everything I need! Very clean and fantastic location! Really recommended!
"A trendy compact room, especially great for solo travellers. Super convenient place with the MRT station a couple mins walk away. Would happily stay here again!"
The place is located at the centre of chinatown with every key tourist spot being closeby. The MRT is meters away and it is surrounded by the food and shopping outlets all around. The management was good but the hotel could do better if it could jazz up the space a bit.
It__ really good money for value to stay in singapore.
"It's very near Chinatown MRT station. It's a much bigger room than other rooms, but you have to climb the stairs with your luggage to the family room. Kids can play in the tub, and it's huge. I think it can fit 4 to 5 Asian adults, or a lot of kids inside. Shower and toilet are separated, and there's no wardrobe but a shelf for your clothes and a stand to hang the clothes. Do remember to ask for extra floor mats for the tub. They only had one in the toilet.

It will be a closed street during Chinese New Year period (one month before the festival), so traveling via MRT is the closest you can reach the hotel during the period. Other than that, the car can reach the building."

"Hillary is a very caring host, very helpful and very thoughtful. I really enjoyed my stay there for 1 month and I really miss the place. It is very near to mrt and very convinience for long term travelling. I really appreciate Hilary's help. Thank you very much Hillary, I would come back and stay there again."

"The room is in a very good position but the photos are not realistic, the room is quite small and in the toilet there is no real shower , there is no the tend and when you have the shower all the toilet is getting wet.

Host messaged that someone will come and check, but, we did not find anyone fixing it anyday. Few small things like dustbin in washroom etc were missing which was difficult to cope with. Also, the room had shaft and unfortunately it rained in singapore 1 day. The water was falling hard in night and we could not sleep. Communication was very slow too."
Good
Place is clean but a bit small...its very close to most areas...
"staffs are very rude, had the worst experience for over 2years that I__ using Airbnb. There was no self-check in. Arrived 12mid at the place but no one can help us to check in, we waited for 30mins_ with no internet connection and can__ call the host due to different network provider. The host didn__ give any contact details too. Would recommend people to book hotels rather "
"Quiet, clean plus peaceful"
The room was clean and tidy however there were times where the host were unresponsive to our enquiries
"Nice place and clean. Only issues is that there are people smoking near the dryers causing smell to enter room. Otherwise, really comfortable. Will definitely recommend to others"
It__ so convenience
"We had a few issues at the office and checked in Xinyu__ place a bit late. Still, she spent her time waiting for us as the gate to give us the key and show us how to use things around the condo including the gym and the pool. We were her first Airbnb guests so everything were completely new! Though we were just 5 people, the place is big enough to accommodate 6 people. Xinyu was very nice and responsive during our 3 nights there. She made sure we got everything we need and our stay was pleasant. The condo is situated in a nice area, by the park, north of Singapore downtown. There are a lot of restaurants and convenience stores (7-eleven) close by.

I highly recommend this place to anyone."
"Had a lovely stay in Xinyu's apartment,it was brandnew,everything was nicely  decorated,highly recommended."
great place.! very clean and brand new condominium. hawker center and many food places are 5 mins walking distance away.  Fair Price too.
"I searched for months before selecting this place! The location is amazing, you__e close to the heartland of Singapore. Down the street from famous chicken and rice place. The MRT is a 8-10 min walk away. The pool is shaded, never saw another place offering that. Can__ find a two bed/bath in this price range. Would rent again! Tina was very responsive."

Good area to stay
Ong's place is nice and cozy! You feel welcome right away. Just below is a big food court with various Chinese restaurants. I enjoyed my stay a lot and can just recommend it.
"Ong and Elle are two of the kindest, most helpful AirBNB hosts we have ever stayed with. When we arrived at the airport after nearly 24 hours of flying and had issues with getting WiFi at the airport, they helped get us safely to the apartment well past midnight. The location was incredible, making day trips to various parts of Singapore very easy, as they are right above an MRT station. We loved being able to walk right outside to a hawker market for delicious food, from morning until late. I already miss Elle and her lovely stories and thoughtfulness felt like staying with family. We will miss them both and hope to see them again someday!"
"Though its space is limited, the area is very clean and quiet. It's a great location because the MRT station is just a few steps away from the building and there's McDonalds and 7/11 nearby. Mr. Ong and Ms. Elle is very accommodating and responds to your queries quickly."
"Muy cÃ³modo y buena ubicaciÃ³n. Elle es una excelente anfitriona. 
Repuestas rÃ¡pidas y muy atentos."
"Never ever go there!!!! There are 7 UNITS for the rental purpose and one room for the caretaker lady!!!!!  2 rooms were inside and no window. No living/dining or kitchen. His apartment can cram up to 10-12 people at any given night, where the maximum number allowed by law is 6 people in such a small apartment!!!"
"My friend and I arrived in Singapore off a cruise, so we were a bit nervous and unsure with our surroundings.   Mr. Ong went above and beyond and picked us up from the cruise terminal and drove us to the accommodation.  
It's the perfect location in Chinatown.  Chinatown is literally downstairs from the apartment.  
There's a woman named Elle who lives in the apartment and takes care of anything you may need- and she is amazing!  We were so sad to leave and we will definitely stay here again!  10 stars!     "
good location
Very good!
Great experience overall. No complaints.
"I see that Ong works tirelessly to provide a comfortable experience for his guests. 
He picked me up at the bus port and even gave me a ride to another destination that evening as a kindness. This man is a treasure and his home is a reflection of that."
"What I liked about this Singapore guest house was that while I was just renting a room, I pretty much had the entire place to myself. The location is just a 5-mins walk to a local strip mall that has local and western food. Since it was near the Hillview MRT Station, I could get to Orchard Road in about 15 mins or Marina Bay in around 25 mins. Their housekeeper too made sure my laundry was in order and also provided most anything I needed during my stay. Having a fast wifi network and Netflix too was a nice touch."
"Robert__ place is one of the best airbnb apartments I__e ever stayed at - tasteful Javanese-style deco, a comfortable bedroom, and amazing amenities including an air-conditioned living room which we have thoroughly enjoyed. Robert was very thoughtful and accommodating to our check-in timing. His helper, Jumi, even helped us with the laundry. I would definitely recommend Robert__ lovely home to anyone."
"Robert is an excellent host. He personally greets his hosts with warmth and hospitality, and what's not to like about a gorgeous cozy space! The experience is truly a gem and I wouldn't hesitate to return again."
"Super friendly host. He even took the time to meet and greet me at the MRT station and showed me the way to his place. Everything was perfect, highly recommended and totally worth the $$$ if you don__ mind walking a few minutes from the MRT station. I know I don__. There__ a 24 hour supermarket and noodles shop nearby, which is a plus."
"Robert__ place was clean and pristine. No shoes inside policy. When you get in you will feel like you are in Zen spa saloon.  Everything you need it was set up already. Coffee and tea station at the kitchen. Noodles and bread are available. Hot water and cooked rice prepared early in the morning. Bathroom was loaded with different essentials oils, toothpaste, shampoo, & conditioner.  
He meet you in person when you check in , has caretaker her name Lumi that can do your laundry too. There are two bikes available that you use if you wanna bike in the morning. 
I woke up one morning it was raining, I haven__ ask anything, umbrella prepared at dining table.  Robert is excellent host! I wish more people like him!"
"Wow. What a find!
I could not have asked for a better stay!. You basically get the whole of a unit, bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and lounge. 
Everything was super clean and it was how I wish my house was! Check in was really easy and Jumi was there to help - she's awesome btw. 
There are bars and restaurants just around the corner and the MRT is very walkable, so I used it all of the time. 
If you are a couple or solo traveller and just want some nice touches and a super cosy place to stay, then this is it. I am DEFINITELY going back again. I can't wait."
"We had a truly amazing stay at Robert's place. He's a very friendly guy, picking us up from the metro and showing us around when we arrived.

Jumi, the housemaid, was very kind and helpful as well. She was kind enough to do our laundry, even as we just came back from a jungle trip to Borneo -- you can image how our clothes looked like, but she got them spotless.

The bedroom is good, the living room (which we practically had all to ourselves) even better. Both are neat and clean and have both AC/DC and a fan.

The location is ideal for tourists: it's a beautiful, calm neighborhood, but the city centre is reached in ~30 minutes using the blue metro line. Notice that the metro doesn't go past midnight, but luckily we were always able to find a Grab when we needed one at late night.

It's a good place for nature-lovers, thanks to the surrounding parks, which also include Singapore's highest point (only 163m, but still). In a single walk, we saw squirrels, turtles, lizards and macaques. 

In conclusion, we were sad to leave after a week already, but a place which we can sincerely recommend for anyone to stay at!"
"Sehr tolle Lokation, mit allem Luxus was das Herz begehrt.. Ob Netflix, warmes Wasser oder eine ausgestattete KÃ¼che. Wir haben die RÃ¤umlichkeiten genauso wie auf den Fotos gezeigt vorgefunden und durften einen sehr charmanten und hilfsbereiten Gastgeber kennen lernen. Wir haben abgesehen vom Wasserdruck gar nichts zu bemÃ¤ngeln "
"Robert and Denise are really great hosts, their house is also great, clean, comfortable and beautiful.
The house is well located.

I wanted to thanks Jumi, the housekeeper who was like a big sister to me, she did an amazing job. I'm glad that I could meet a person like her. She is really helpful and reactive about your demands."
"Perfect experience, perfect location for me which is just near the hillview MRT"
"We found Roberts home to be wonderful, and should we come to Singapore again, we will definitely book again. Loved Jumi the home helper who was simply amazing helping us wherever she could. Only about 25 mins by MRT to most places in the city. The best Indian restaurant just down the road. Thanks for the use of the mountain bikes to explore the nearby nature reserve with! I can't thank you enough for the refreshing time we had at your house."
"We enjoyed our stay, location to transport, food supplies & helpful advice all Good"
"Joseph's place was amazing, it was sparkling clean and full of amenities that weren't even mentionned in the description. His assistant Jumi was a sweetheart and made sure our stay was more than perfect everyday. The location was ideal to get around the city. as it was close to a MRT station.  It exceed our expectations and was simply perfect for us. Communication with Joseph was also very easy and efficent. Great value, great place, great host, would recommend 10/10."
"Recommended for people who like a quiet and calm environment.
Joseph creates a wonderful environment for the guests.  The interior decoration was very good. There was no noise from the neighborhood. We were able to relax at Joseph's place. In terms of room size and facilities, I thought staying here is far better than staying at a hotel in the city for a higher price.

Down this residential area, there are 2 Rail Malls and there are various restaurants. There is also a supermarket, which is convenient, but you can not buy alcohol after 10:30pm (you can drink it at the bar).

It takes about 1 hour and 20 minutes by MRT to Sentosa Island and about 1 hour to the Airport. I remember that the MRT fare to the Airport was around S$2.50, not expensive at all.

Speaking of Jumi, she is a housekeeper here, has a very nice character and my 10 years old daughter soon likes her.
I would like to stay here the next time."
Great quiet place for a stay in Singapore. It was clean and close enough to walk from a nearby MRT station and although the area was not in the middle of the central business district it was easy to jump on the public transport.
"The place here is as perfect as I can imagine. Joseph has considered all the details that a tourist may meet, and also the enthusiastic helper Jumi, who did the housework for us. The supermarket, the restaurant both are nearby. Actually, the MRT of Hillview station is beside the house. Without any hesitate we will choose it again when we travel to Singapore the next time!"
We had a lovely stay at Joseph's place. The room has great air conditioning which was fantastic in the Singapore heat. The house is located close to Hillview MRT which makes the city and nature parks easily accessible. There is also a 24 hour grocery store nearby. They offer laundry service and have a fully equipped kitchen.
Joseph is a great host and highly recommend staying at his place. Close to the MRT and nearby hiking trails. Accommodation was everything you would hope to expect.
"We had a great staying here for 3 days. The house is super clean and with neat decoration. Don't worry about the location, it's very near to the subway station towards downtown and also a bus station with multiple line, SG is a very easy to travel place after all. We've got everything we need even food for a quick breakfast. Joseph is easy to communicate and respects privacy. I should say the place is more than the price worthy."
"Joseph's place is very nice, convenience location, very clean.. u got more than what u paid all i can say.. communication with Joseph is outstanding, very quick responses.. definitely will come back again.. â­__â­__â­"
"We had four nights stay in Joseph__ place . And we like here very much. This is excellent house with good breakfast, good bed room, excellent dining table with fresh fruits, kitchen is well equipped,you can make good dinner, and we are happy with  good laundry here. 
The place is not in center but transport very convenient ( MRT and bus near by) . Supermarket is next house.
We will return here if back to Singapore.
Thanks Joseph."
"If 100 is full score, i am giving 200 for this prefect stay. Location is good, closed to MRT and a 24h market nearby, also some good restaurant as well. House is pretty and clean, lots of privacy, we do have a wonderful time during our stay"
Very nice hosting with spacious apartment. We loved to use the bikes! There's a nice park just around the corner and restaurants and stores just 3 min away. We could also use the kitchen which is fully equipped. We felt at home!
"Definitely a 5 stars host who does make sure you arrive the guest house hassle free, stay comfortably and check out thinking on when to check in again.

A big credit to Jumi as well as she will make you feel at home away from home during your stay.

Highly recommendable to fellow travellers.

Cheers"
"The stay itself is great. The room and toilet just outside has everything you need for a good stay. There are even additional thoughtful things like bread and butter in the kitchen and tea and coffee.

Location is good too, it's a 7-10 min walk to the mrt. It is also close to the bukit timah nature reserve, which is nice for outdoor physical activities.

However, if i just had 1 gripe, it would be that the host is a little unfriendly. And also seems to quickly assume the worst in the guests. If he was just a tad nicer, then it would have been an excellent stay."
Joseph place was really comfortable. The entire setup was beautifully done and truly feels like a home. My parents enjoyed the stay a lot so much so that they ask me to book it again for the next stay. The house comes with great amenities and the surrounding is quiet. I would highly recommend this place.
"Highly recommend ! The place is quiet, bed-comfort, spacious, clean, and well equipped, there's even a Salad tower ! definitely, a come back again."
"Clean, tidy and surly worth the cost. Both Joseph and Jmi are very nice and friendly. Thank you very much."
"They even provide fresh fruit, coffee, tea for breakfast."
"Joseph was a great host. 

Quick responses to messages, flexible with a reservation addition and he really helped out when we got caught without umbrella's in the rain.

The place is great - lots of room, amenities provided and a location that really worked for us."
Lovely place and well recommended
Awesome place! Would stay there again:)
The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
the owners are super nice
The host canceled this reservation 25 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
Highly recommended. The hostel is clean. The staff are really friendly and approachable. They are ready to assist you at any time.
"The Seven Wonders hostel is located in the middle of buzzing Little India, and everything is really close! We took the metro everywhere which was perfect. The beds are comfy, the rooms clean, and there is even a rain-shower. The breakfast is minimal but very nice! Overall we loved to stay here and would definitely book here again."
Great Hostel
Good to stay at your hostel. Staff was so kind and informative. The place was clean. Breakfast was also good. But little bit noisy near the hostel.
Good
Clean bed and bathrooms. Good breakfast. Staffs are kind.
Nice place to stay as you don't disturb people when they are resting 
"Limited public area, clean enough for a budget trip"
"My first ever stay in Singapore has been great because of this place. Feels like a community. Clean and spacious, and although shared rooms it's still possible to have that sense of privacy to yourself. However, there aren't many toilets at this place and the showers are kinda small too. Otherwise great! The breakfast was nice, and they provided shampoo too. Great experience. Will definitely book here again."
"It was such a pleasant stay. Location is great, it__ near Little India Station. The only concern we had during our stay is that one of the air conditioning units inside the room is not working so it__ a bit humid."
"Good:
* Friendly staff
* Very close to MRT (train)
* You can find interesting places and food in Little India
* The bed was comfy
* Good Air Conditioner = Good sleep

Bad:
* You should bring soap and toilet paper just in case
* Some guesses don't follow the quiet hour time (i.e. Are not quiet during night time)

Overall:
For the price, it's a really good place. If you are not comfortable sharing room with several strangers and can afford somewhere else, go for it; otherwise, I'd recommend this place for sure"
Great location

More shoe rack and provide some paper slippers
Thank you for accommodating. Definitely recommend the place.

I stayed here for 4 nights and I have no complaints. The staff were very nice and helpful. The breakfast was simple but clean and great to start the day. The beds were comfortable with good AC running. Located in the heart of Little India and close to about everything you wish to visit depending on your means of transportation. I was in a room with 4 bunk beds and it was quiet. The bunks were spacious and they come with a curtain which is always a plus in my book.
"The room was clean, staff was friendly and helpful."
"It's a pretty well located hostel, you are in Little India and if you want to eat not expensive food it's perfect.
The room was a little bit smaller than expected but for 3 nights it was fine.
I recommend it if you want to stay less than a week"
Its a full hostel experience with bunk beds and everything... Staff is helpful... Clean beds ... Can't complain about bathroom... U will have to adjust... Its a hostel after all... good location... Good if u want to travel for cheap price..
Good place and friendly staff
Great place loves staying
Acceptable sleeping condition. The room clean. The bed acceptable for the amount you paid. Quite surprised they serve simple breakfast which is value added service by the hostel
"1. Nearby to Little India & Jalan Besar MRT station.
2. Suitable for short stay
3. Bunk bed was comfy but the room was a bit small. Rather difficult to get up.
4. Bathroom also a bit small rather basic toiletries"

Good value and convenient.
"Singapore is a very expensive place. So staying at a hostel like 7 Wonders will cut off the expenses specially if you are a solo traveller in a span of couple of days. For the first timers in a hostel like me, you might not like the idea of being in a room with different people with only limited space to move around. But mind you, It didnt take a while for me to adjust my self in this hostel because its amazing! Now, this place is amazingly cheap but with great and superb feature. Its easy to locate as just a few meters away from little india mrt station. Safe and very quiet at night so you can have a peaceful sleep. Im so lucky during my stay to have been roommates with very considerate people. no one was unbecoming and all were well behave. Breakfast! This is the highlights of them all. Toasted bread with selections of spreads. Hot coffee and cereal meals fruits and milks, name it! Its all there! Cleanliness, the rooms and the washrooms are not that big but it__ manageable, clean and tidy. Personnels, are amazing! They talk politely and answer your question promptly. In short my stay at this hostel is great! I will definitely recomment this place and will sure book it again soon!"
The stay was good but the room was a bit dusty as I was beside the window. It was also warm I did not feel the airconditioning unit until the morning.
"The stay was below average, the breakfast was very limited and was usually over before time. The washroom had a really bad smell and was extremely tiny. Choose this place only if you__e on a tight budget. The location is reasonable as it__ 500 meters from the MRT station. Also great location for people who love Indian food. However the area is pretty much dead past 10 pm. No amenities or common areas for you to meet new people."
Clean and cheap !
"Great location, good hospitality and value for money."

"Right in the heart of little India - three minute walk to the nearest food court.
You can take the airport shuttle directly here for 9sd, but be sure to select the ""upper Dickson "" version of seven wonders when booking.


Great place, friendly staff, would stay again, yadda yadda."
"Great quality for the price. You can take the shuttle from Changi Airport right to the door for 9sd (just choose seven wonders Upper Dickson for the booking) , or the Mrt for even less.

Complimentary breakfast is always great, and situated smack bang in the middle of little India and near the Queen Road bus station for if you're heading to malaysia. 

Friendly staff, nice beds, clean."
"Very kind personal, great location in the middle of Little India. Cleaning service every day! Four great days in Singapore :)"
"Overall very central, nice Hostel in Little India!"
"Nice location, friendly staff, kichen place is smaler then expected, room was way to cold, because of the ac."

Hospitable and great service
great place to stay. great location and seven the host is great easy to communicate.
Worth for price. Comfortable bed. Clean toilet + bathroom. Others travelers aren't making any noise during night time. Great stay
"Nice to have a queen size bed at a hostel for travelling as a couple. Clean bedding, a few washrooms/showers available if there is a line."
Great location and best value for money!
nice hostel close to the MRT subway. the check-in was easy and drinking water always accessible. bathrooms could be a bit cleaner
"The place is not so spacious since it__ capsule based theme. But, it is very comfy to sleep and rest for the night."
"If you want to visit Little India itself location would be great, but the surrounding buildings are a bit messy. They don't have an elevator so expect to carry you luggages up to the 2nd floor, not too high though. You have a person B&T but you can't carry your shoes inside your room. They also have free brrakfast which are bread and some spreads, cereal and milk, oranges, and coffee. Clean as you go, so you wash your own dishes after breakfast. The space for breakfast is quite small so do not expect too much. The room as well. The workers are very polite and helpful though. If you want to get good food you can ride the mrt its just a 5 min walk and you can go everywhere."
It was a nice experience to stay here. The hostel near from MRT station and bus stop. will definitely stay here again with my friend.
I think the breakfast should change daily.
Nice! Fit for 8 people in 1 room

"What you see, you get better. Thank you 7 wonders. Such a recommended place to stay. Budget friendly and tourist friendly at one."
Good
Exceeds expectation for an affordable price.
Recommended place.
"A wonderful budget place for travellers . Do not expect luxury. The basics are met. If you have people who are not comfortable with hostel mode or capsule mode , you would want to look at other options. You will have to climb the stairs with your luggage . The staff there are quite responsive. Breakfast is basic and free, it is the same everyday."
"The hostel was really okay for the price, the breakfast more like something to kill the morning hunger . The only thing was annoying staff who didn__ knock and went into our room with no permission to clean up . They were so nice and let us keep the luggage for free in the storage and also use the shower . I reccomend it for a quick Singapore getaway ."
Great stay for travelers!!
Good for bag packers!
Clean and peaceful hostel strategically located near the MRT (3-5mins walk)
Overall my short stay was really great and the place was clean and comfortable  as me and my friends (5 person in total) had a comfortable sleep because the room is for us. The bathroom is nice as well it has water heater and clean. The price is okay worth the value. The staffs there were really helpful as well. Thank you!
"There are stairs to go to the receptionist, so travel light."

"Good location, nice house, clean bed.
Everything is good for my family."
"Great place near bugis and little india.

No elevator. You must go up with stairs.

Very clean bathroom."
Better than I expected!
"SUPERBE, cette propriÃ©tÃ© est recommandÃ©e _ vous tous"
Good for back packers
"Perfect accommodation for a few days in Singapore if you are into hostellife. Super central, staff was very friendly and even the breakfast was alright. RÃ©sumÃ©: Great price/performance ratio."
"Lovely staff, and great location: close to hawker centre and central met line"
"This was our great decision to book this place in Singapore. 
Staffs were super helpful with everything. 
Since we were a first timer in Singapore, Ms. Mae was the one who helped us there. She helped us book our Bus to KL since we forgot to book it online (we thought walk ins are fine but no, our fault sorry)

Our family room was really good! 10/10
Breakfast was so lit! _¤ï_ 

We really had a nice stay here. 
Recommended to all budget travellers. "
"Feel warm and comfortable stay. So happy and enjoy!
Overall are very good, but toilet need clean well!"
The place and staff are so nice!
The place is farther than expected. Really for bagpackers. Not for family trips.
"Was a fun experience sleeping in personalised bunk beds, complete with night light, curtain, hangers and power sockets in each bed. Recommended for backpackers, much more fun with friends. Location was 10 mins walk from bugis which was a plus and 5 mins from the closest MRT.

I went with my family and it was really fun to communicate with your siblings from the other beds, but unless you__e curious about sleeping in cozy spaces (like we were), looking to greatly save costs, and staying just for a few nights, I wouldn__ say the space is entirely for families. Not for any other reason than the vibe and location wise which is right in the middle of little india where children wouldn__ find much to do. Perfect if you__e with friends though!! 

Overall had a great experience!!"
Easy to get around
Nice placee
"The place is great and clean. Only downside is you cannot check in early. But it__ okay because they accommodated our luggages. This place is actually better that I expected. I loved it, my family loved it. We will come back for sure. Thank you to the team at 7 wonders!"
"Staying at Seven gave me another nice and new experience. My friends and I got to sleep in bunk beds and shared the bathroom with other guests. The hosts were nice, and the breakfast was good and convenient. The place is very good for traveler."
"The place is clean, and the service is good"
"Wonderful time in Singapore with family thanks part in to 7 Wonders Hostel that a hostel worth staying with family, big group or small group. I'll sure choose to stay this hostel if i have a trip with my family in Singapore in the future."
"The family room that we__e stayed was awesome. It was really a good value for the money, knowing we could have our own private room in a hostel. Staff was great & accommodating. Definitely will recommend this one for big groups."
"The 7 Wonders Hostel is a  great place to stay. The place is very clean, convenient, and accessible to all modes of transportation. All the staff are great and are always ready to help. I am rating this place 5 stars and I highly recommend this place."
The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

"Exactly what you would expect from a Hostal. Not a lot of common areas, just straight to business, beds in shared rooms. Cereal and sandwiches for breakfast are a plus that I forgot I was getting. The bathrooms are very clean all the time, and while they're super strict with their check-in times, they did take care of my luggage while I went to eat outside and waited for 3pm to come around"
"It was very nice to stay.
People who work at this hostel was super kind.
Definitely recommend to all travelers! !"
"This place is great! The location is in the middle of everywhere that it's not far to go somewhere in your itinerary. And near to 3 MRT stations. 

The free breakfast is yum yum! You need to try it too. It is self service by the way.

The mixed rooms is nice. The solo bed is comfy too and has each socket and light for you. 

They have more bathrooms to be used and has bidet. 

All the receptionist is all friendly. 

It is great for both solo or group travelers to check in too. No problem with that. You can make some new friends all the way. 

The rent is worth it. "
Great spot. Great location. Friendly staff.

Great place to stay; this is a very ideal place to stay if you are touring around the city. But I would suggest not to book the place if you're travelling with infants and elderlies.

"The hostel is very clean and the staff is friendly. The free breakfast was also okay.
The beds are really cosy and you don__ have to do them yourself.
Two of our roommates were awful but this wasn__ the fault of the hostel.
All in all it was a great stay."
"The bed and pillows are super comfortable. Lots of convenience to all sightseeings,  F & B and shoppings from MRT station Little India. The front desk is helpful and very friendly. Highly recommended."

"Good hostel in the heart of Little India. Nice location, kind staff.
The only thing I wasn__ the biggest fan off was the bathroom situation..
There were only 4 toilets and four showers, and the toilets were IN the shower room, so you sometimes had to wait a long time to be able to either go to the toilet or take a shower..
Other than that, I can__ complain for the price.. the bed was comfortable and the breakfast simple but appreciated (also vegan options! White toast doesn__ contain milk and the butter actually isn__ butter but margarine.. so you can eat toast with __utter_, peanutbutter, or strawberry jam.. cereal is vegan as well, you would just have to bring your own milk alternative)."
"We stayed at 7 Wonder's Hostel for about 5 days, it's the perfect hostel for budget travel! The people at the reception and super helpful and very accomodating of us coming in late, etc. The rooms are a little smaller than what it seems in the photos, but it's convenient and comfortable!"
Thank you for the excellent services!
Pretty nice and comfy place
Muy buen hostel para pasar unas noches en Singapur. El desayuno incluido es un plus

Accurate!

Good for short stay
"A very nice place to stay, the location is great."
"Super clean dorms and good light breakfast included (bread with different spreads, cereal, and powdered coffee/tea). Staff is very helpful and the location is awesome--in the middle of Little India and walking distance to lots of attractions like Fort Canning and the National Museum. It's not a particularly social hostel though, so if you're looking for that sort of atmosphere, maybe check elsewhere."
All people there really friendly. Strongly suggested
It's a great place. Clean space
Affordable price. Friendly staff. Clean place. Simple breakfast. Good location.
It's a great place that is worth its value for a short stay!
Nice and cheap place to stay in (expensive) Singapore and near the metro. Easy to reach. Basic but perfect for one night. Breakfast was also really nice.
highly recommend this place. Good value for money. Very accessible
Value for money
lovely hosts and lovely place.
Dorm is clean and comfortable price for budget travel.
"Definitely worth the value. I was there for business, so I didn__ spend much time."
"Great location,good rooms. Definitely recommend ."
"Seven's hostel would be an ideal place for a quick night's stay in the Little India part of Singapore. It was very clean, and the staff was very helpful in pointing out local resources for me as a visitor, even a late night bite to eat."
This place was safe and in a good location. Close to the MRT and surrounded by many stores and restaurants. The managers and workers were very helpful and kind! I wish the bathrooms were bigger but the bed was comfortable. Also would love the option to choose the bunk you get. All in all it was a great trip and stay!
"We had a good experience staying here. Everything is clean, security is good with digital lock for each room, free lockers also provided (with $10 deposit), delicious breakfast (breads with several jams, cereals, and oranges), bed is very comfy and clean, rooms are cool. 

We just had a little problem about the room. I booked 5 beds and there__ no explanation that this is a female room, so I thought it will be okay for our group (which consist 1 male) to stay together in 1 room but when I checked in, the reseptionist said that this is a female room only and one of my friend (male) must be separated in different room. We__e bit dissapointed about this, hopefully they can make a more clear description for the listing. 

Actually the hostel manager already tried some ways to make us in one room, but because it consisted if 6 beds and we__e 5, so there__ one girl out of our group that sleeps in our room and she didn__ want any man in the room. So, yeah my friend must be sleeping in other room in the end. 

But beside the room problem, everything was just great as I mentioned above."
Very nice for one night !
Very convenient for anyone who is looking for an affordable and a quick stay.
Good staffs but not flexible
Had a great stay at 7 Wonders Hostel. It__ in the heart of Little India and is a short walk away from the mrt/bus station.
Nice place to stay if you want to have a cheap yet clean and a place near to the station
"Good value for money. Super centrally located in little India. Staff very friendly. Breakfast simple but good (cereals, toast, tea, coffee). Very clean. Beds are no real capsules, only a curtain. Gives some privacy but no protection from noise that other people in the room might make."
"Dormitory was o.k as expected,  bathroom might be cleaner or could use some refurbishing but in general quite good.
The location was great near public transport and some attractions were accessible on foot what is very convenient.
Good opotion for a short stay."
That's good

"The bed was super comfy, comparing to other hostels I've stayed in. Good hospitality by the staff. Clean and comfortable."
"Good place in Little India with comfortable beds. Nice staff and good breakfast, which can be very crowded at times."
"Cheap accommodation in Little India, close to MRT, aircondition, breakfast and locker included in price."
"The location is near mrt station and bus stop, clean room"
Nice services and staff here
My stay at Tribe Theory was amazing. You__l meet motivated entrepreneurs there. It__ a much more unique experience than staying in a hostel or a generic Airbnb. You__l find community there
"This is such a great place for someone traveling on a budget. The location is situated 5-10 min walking distance between 3 MRT/subway stations. There is a lot of affordable and delicious food in the area. The hostel staff work long hours so you have people who can give advice or recommend things around town. The hostel is very small but efficient and well run. There is a rigorous cleaning schedule and a simple but nice, daily breakfast routine. The lobby floor has several dorm rooms, each with a bathroom and two extra bathrooms on the end of the floor. The rooms are always cool and the beds are set up with individual reading lights and charging outlets. One thing to note is that the rooms are mixed gender, men and women in one room. Also, the beds are bunked and you__l need to spend a small refundable deposit on the key to lock your things under the bed. The lock space is the size of an airline cabin for carry on luggage. But if you have big luggage, there is space in the room to put it against the wall. This is not the kind of hostel to relax at unless you want to be in bed. There isn__ a cozy lounge at this location. But, the price is great and the location is very accessible to get all around the city. There area seems pretty safe early in the morning and later at night. I was a little nervous at first but it was totally fine! Would definitely come again if I was traveling alone or with enough friends to rent out a 6-bed room."
Thanks for the awesome stay! Good place for a short term trip.
"This is a quite good hostel for people who travel on budget. There__ a good breakfast and the beds are isolated with a curtain, we also have our own lamp and spot to charge devices. The restrooms are clean and the location is excellent, not far from MRT and inside Little India area."
"Very nice service and staff, but very tiny spaces. Big people cannot use bathroom or toilet. That small. If big luggage, have to carry all the way narrow stairs."
"A private space after a long day trip, i will not recommend the place."
Great hostel for one or two days! Bathroom isn__ as well stocked as I liked. But excellent for the value. Don__ think too much about it. It__ a hostel!
"This hostel was great! Clean, good location and comfortable. The service was superb, the hosts were so kind and very helpful with tips and information. Thanks so much!!"
"Ruangan dingin, kamar mandi bersih, sarapan ok, pelayanan yang ramah dan area yang aman. Thank you :)"
"Thank you for the stay, 7 wonders! Nice option for someone on a budget "
"Good dorm, neat and tidy and breakfast is a bonus. Easy to get anywhere you need to go."
Nice cheap hotel in Little India to stay a few night in Singapore.
"It__ a hostel with basically no common spaces or room to do anything other than sleep in a freezing cold A/C room. Location is good and the people who I met while there were solid humans but for me, not making list of good hostels I__e stayed in."

"Considering the location, and the increased price of accommodation in a city of Singapore, this is good option to base if you are only looking for the place to sleep. What I like here best is staff who works here. Such a great hospitality they have! I would recommend this place mostly because of that."
Clean and friendly staff. Good breakfast
They give great travel tips at the reception

Great place! very comfortable feels just like home and host was very friendly and welcoming.
Great option that is pretty central
"Christine__ place was awesome! It's super close to lots of cool bars and restaurants, plus on Friday nights then close down Club Street and all the bars set up tables in the middle of the street. Check-In and out was a breeze and Christine was always easily contactable."
Good experience. Good location although the noise at night due to nearby bars. Helpful and prompt answers.

We loved the place!
"Location is excellent, just a few minutes walk from Chinatown, and easy access to buses and MRT network. Easy 20 minute ride to the airport. The flat is in good condition and as advertised, with a washing machine and fridge. Recommended"

"Pros:
- The instructions were clear, easy check-in & check-out... 
- location was quite alright. Near from the F1 night race venue.. walking distance ( 15 min).
- the place was so cozy and we love the sofa.
- very clean.
- easy access to mrt stations ( telok ayer, 10 minute walk; chinatown exit F, 5-8 minute walk).
- cooking station and appliances were very helpful.
- lots of clothes hanger.
- convenient washing + dryer machine), with detergents also provided.

Cons:
- no microwave.
- no iron or ironing board inside the room.
- no cable tv; not a smart tv.
- no vitrage or curtains at the living room.
- minimal space for hanging laundry.
- late night noises from neigbouring bars in the weekend.

Overall, if possible i would absolutely love to stay there again.."
"This was a centrally located area in Chinatown and not to far from the MRT which could take you to the bayfront in 2 stops. Reported problem with Moldy shower curtain and orange mold around the shower area.  Hair in bathroom.  Hopefully they will resolve. Surprised to find a list that requires the guest to do part of the cleaning which we pay for.  Be aware of the restaurant below the apartment in which you can hear noise until they close. 
Pictures looked more modern but the place is older than expected."

"This place is very spacious, clean, nice and secure.  Christine has kept this place very comfortable for guests.  Being at the edge of Chinatown, and being very close to the MRT station, the location is super.  We really enjoyed our stay there.  It is definitely money well spent."
"We loved our stay! The place is so spacious, the location is great but kinda noisy after 7pm because it's located next to bars. One thing that we actually dont like is there was no curtains so it got really bright in the morning when we still tried to sleep. But other than that, it was great! Thanks!"
"We stayed at this location between 5-12 Nov 2019

Communication lacked, reserved flat and asked question about checking in/contact info, response was never provided, two months before hearing back with instructions. Took hours to get a response, and typically never addressed questions.

They were very responsive concerning billing us.

The check in procedures sent worked well and had no problem actually getting into the room etc_ 

Accuracy of description of flat;

Bathroom
Photos were not of the flat we reserved and paid for
They were of a different newly renovated bath, ours was old and dirty
Scum/dirt at faucet, peeling caulking, mildew, mold, hair ball in drain, cock roach, dirty shower curtain and water drained onto floor, bath tile painted, runs in paint, looked horrible would not have reserved this flat if pictures of bath were correct
No plug for hair dryer in bathroom, had to dry hair in kitchen with no mirror.

Linens/Towels
Rented flat specifically for second bed (sleeper sofa), two of us traveling together, required two beds with two rooms. 
On arrival, no sheets/pillows for sleeper sofa, or cover for extra comforter, requested sheets told $100 more
Christine said I should have told her we needed sheets; prior notice not stated in listing
How would I know to tell her to have sheets for all the beds reserved  
Specific reason we reserved flat was for two beds, if not could have a studio.  
Never provided sheets, pillows or cover for comforter even after multiple request.  We were being extorted for additional $100.

Towels
Description states linens/towels (plural) provided, expecting bath, hand, wash cloth and dish towel, be provided
Provided only one bath each for one week stay
If stayed minimum stay, they would change out the towels after 3 days +/-.  
Main issues was not being provided the assortment needed, no kitchen dish towels or hand towels .  Again, requested and turned down had to use paper towels all over the place.

Cleanlines 
Place was not clean, not dirty, but did find old ice cream container in freezer, dirty sink sponge for our use and stale water in kettle and stinky sour bath mat left in washer
Walls had dirt, scuffs etc., bathroom as described above mold/mildew
Number one rule posted, KEEP CLEAN, but nothing was provided to clean, no broom, dust pan, cleaners_

Amenities
Description, we should bring personal amenities, understood, brought shampoo, soap, tooth paste all the normal stuff.  
Provided only two small cheap rolls of toilet paper, requested more, told it was a personal amenity and not described in listing we are to bring own TP
I have never carried TP on any travels.  Again if stayed minimum nights, still would receive two rolls, if alone I would have two rolls, so the longer you stay and more people you have the lower the ration of TP s provided.  
Listing states, __magine being in a Hotel,_ but when asked about sheets, towels, TP, laundry soap etc_ was told, __his is not a hotel_.

Clothes washer, not clear in description you need to bring your own washing detergent, again, not a normal amenity I carry.  Not in description to bring my own.  Was told after I paid. Typically I have found that long stay places provide 1-2 rations of dishwasher or laundry soap, to get you started.  

We had to immediately go to the grocery store and buy household goods.

Noise
Significant issue, Christine mentions __un_ noise on weekends, OK with that, understood to mean, street noise etc_ on F/S nights.  
She specifically mentions noise, but fails to indicate anywhere in the listing he entire building sits directly over a brewery/bar with outside seating.  People sat literally 10 ft. from our BR window, drinking, yelling singing and screaming.  
Noise hours were every day 11am-23pm and on Sunday, they had very loud live music, fortunately good music.  
Also, failed to mention a significant construction project across the small alleyway, huge earth boring machines.  Appears to be constructing large building, this grinding noise lasted everyday between 8-18.  So pounding, steel tracks grinding, soaring noise etc_ all day.
This is now indicated in the listing, but not at the time or after our reservation was made.

Access
Provided only one key, which created logistic issues with two people.

The location was absolutely great for Club st, China Town and easy walk to MRT and the bed was very comfortable.

I would not stay again, due to lack of basics, towels, laundry soap, TP, sheets and the never ceasing noise, but the main problem was the lack of responsiveness and lack of giving a damn about our stay."
Great space and location! Loved it.
place was very convenient
Clean rooms and good location
Very cozy and spacious but so pricy
"Everything is okay. The place is quite clean. Just that the toilet is so small. And tiles looks very old. Kitchen is dirty too. Saw a few bugs. But above all, it is still a nice place to stay."
Great place. Superb location. Hassle free checking-in. Definitely value for money.
Good place to stau
"It was very nice place for me.

Place is clean and host was responsive and very welcoming as well! Great place for a short and chill getaway from the city/work. will definitely come again! :)
"__¸¸__°¢_¿ä¸»ä¸_´ç__°å__,_¿ä¸»å¾_ice!"
The place was prettier in person! Wei was very friendly and easy to talk to and the amenities were amazing! there were additional mattresses as well which was a pleasant surprise :) thank you for the amazing apartment !!
Very near the airport and accessible via LRT and MRT. Wei__ place is definitely recommended. The place was very clean and had nice views of the neighborhood. Really comfortable to stay in especially with 3 airconditioners. Bathroom is really nice. Host was very nice and very responsive. 5 stars!
Good host. Extra effort made when I was late
"Really wonderful stay, access to gym and swimming pool was great! Very comfortable place for 2, wouldn't mind booking again! Also, host was very nice and allowed early arrival despite last minute request."
Very good and nice place! Beautiful house!
Everything was perfect and thank you. I'm willing to visit again :)
Everything was good. Wei waited for me till 1145pm as my flight n custom was delay but still waited for me and was very friendly aft i reached..
Excellent place to stay.
Very cozy and quiet place with an excellent view at night. The apartment is well-furnished and has a very homely and comfortable feel. Well-suited for 2 people to stay in. The hosts are friendly and accomodating and responds quickly to queries.
"Please don__ book this apartment we have used Airbnb all over the world. We have never had so much trouble checking in. 
We contacted the host when booking explained that we would love to check in early. As Our international flight into Singapore was at 7am. It was an early start at 6am and arriving the next morning at 7am.They agreed to that for an extra cost. 
Two days prior they cancelled this. Which was fair enough. 
They agreed new check in was 1pm. After four metro changes from the airport we arrived at 1.30pm. Contacted the phone no we were given. Their phone dropped out. Long story short. After we waiting hours we got in at 6pm!!
Then the apartment was located on side of complex close to the busy road. Lots of traffic noise, motorbikes at 3am. Low flying planes. 
A very uncomfortable bed. Hence no sleep for two nights.
Our restful two days stopover did NOT turn out to be as we hoped.
Chilling by the pool on our first day did not happen!! Instead just being stressed trying to check in.
Our one plus we had an early flight from Singapore and needed to leave at 5am and the distance was 20minutes grab ride and only $22 Singapore dollars. 
We felt the person who checked us in was the host but he did not care about any of the inconveniences.
Also note there is a washing machine in the space but it does not work.
The kitchen has one knife one spoon and one fork"
The place is very clean
"It was a good stay at Wei__ place. The place is clean, in a good apartment condo and has the necessary amenities. Recommended for a family or business stays"
"Nice house and host. Host doesn__ disturb you unnecessarily. Only location wise, when you book Grab, it will take some time for drivers to locate you. But all is good."
"If you love to swim and gym, Wei's apt is highly recommended. The place is also very comfortable."
Great place and strategically located.
Fast response to messages. The house is really clean and full of facilities. Love it!
Really awesome place. It was really clean and everything was well provided. Communication was really easy as well. Had a great time!
"Cozy place, host is friendly, recommended to all"

Entertainment system is not good"
Great place to stay! We really like it.

"Cozy space for my wife and I with our toddler daughter but we made it work. She loved the playground and if we had more time, the pool looks great too. Conveniently located near the Rivervale plaza and another food court. Would be happy to stay again."
Quite clean and cozy. Pool gym and jacuzzi available. Place is small and TV does not work. Overall not worth S$197.
"Affordable room in a good location. You're about 15m walk to the MRT (S$2.17 from the airport, S$1.79 to downtown) and there are many food courts in the complex. The Chinese Garden is worth the visit.
I didn't meet the host during my stay, so I have nothing to say there. Her little boy is pleasant company, though.
The room is simple and cozy (a positive, since the AC cools it down quickly). Bed is fine. The bathroom is smelly, which I believe is a result of the building plumbing, not cleanliness.
Would stay again."
Cute little room and in a nice area a bit removed from the hustle of the city. Very close to Jurong lake which is very nice!
"Good location, close to food, supermarkets and public transportation. Room is small, but acceptable for the solo budget traveler. Would recommend."

"The family was really pleasant to be around and was very respectful of my privacy. The accommodation is very modest, so I would recommend for a solo traveler on a budget with low expectations. The price was very fair when you compare to other listings in the Singapore area. Walking distance from Chinese gardens MRT station with plenty of shops and laundry, places nearby, etc. I was grateful for the place to stay and wish the family the very best :)"
I stay here for two months. I suggest to those who're finding the cutest and quiet place to stay in Singapore. You will meet a friendly host and have a good experience of relaxing. I will come back again!
"Great place, great location, rather book an apartment then some random hotel."

Thanks Aaron for last minute help! I had a very good and smooth communication with from the start till end of our stay at his place.  Thank you Air bnb as well!  
"It was a very comfortable space.
Thanks to the early check-in, the transfer support was also helpful.
The price is reasonable and it is large enough for 6 people."

"A really good place to stay for a big family, it has everything you need, quite close to food and groceries and easily access to MRT. will definitely come back again! thank you so much!"
It__ a nice clean place in a good location
"Nothing much to say except: PERFECT. The neighbourhood is really pretty, also very convenient food-wise and transport-wise. Quick walk to bus stations and Aljunied MRT station.

I like the room itself. Very cozy and private, right on the first floor. Superb.

I love the kitchen and dining area a lot. It__ definitely a nice communal space to just meet other tenants/travellers. Very well-designed.

The host was also very helpful, quick to respond, and gave a lot of useful tips. So thank you for that :)"
The host was great and communication was good but unfortunately I had issues with ants and roaches in the property. I believe they are working to seal the gaps and fix this ASAP. They seem very nice and professional and I would stay again once they fix the bug problem. The property itself is good and it__ priced accordingly since it is slightly out of the way and the bathrooms are exposed to the outside so that__ probably why I had issues with bugs. The bus and MRT are both very close and there are a lot of late night options for food just outside the houses.  If you are going to CBD/ Marina Bay Area realistically budget 30-40 mins via bus/MRT. By taxi it__ less than 15 mins away so it__ not far.
"Great stay, no issues."
"Great location, very nice room and Elle is super helpfull"
"I spent eight days in Singapore and eight nights in the house. Elle is a good manager. The house is small and has all kinds of necessaries. But usually you need to open the window and breathe. One day, Dear Elle helped me braid my hair. She was really a friendly person. In short, everything here is worth looking forward to, the only requirement is that your English needs to be good!"
"Great locations, easy to access. The room fit for business trip."
"Bedroom was cozy and had many nice touches to it such as plug adapters. AC is right above the bed and works great, plus a great view!"
"Great location, easy access.  Very good for backpackers or people with small luggage. older  Style Singapore building, so it doesn't have direct elevator access on the floor,    Now the problem, it is just two flights of stairs.  But for elderly and people with large luggage,  It would be more inconvenient."
"Truly great value for a clean efficiency (with a surprising sink in the room!). An unbeatable location right in Chinatown and right near the hawker you probably want to go to, and there's an easy, flat, short walk to the city and airport transport lines. However, do confirm with the host about the check-in process prior to booking. I stress that ultimately it worked out, but check-in was not smooth for me, and I had an unpleasant interaction with the first security guard where they seized my guest card, locked me out, and had me contact the host to verify me. Had I no data or phone I would have been stranded. And it may be an idiosyncratic sensitivity but I do not feel comfortable staying at places that are closely guarded by security guards 24/7, since even after check-in your (obviously touristy) coming-and-goings are watched."
Great place to stay with so many amenities and so much attention to detail. TV even has Netflix!
"Good location, quick response! Clean bathroom, and tidy room though a bit smaller than I expected."
"Exactly as the description says - great location, views included, clean, comfortable, and good value. Really enjoyed my stay here, and found it ideal. I'm glad I chose this option instead of hotel for the same price. Also, great communication from Ong. Thanks guys!"
"I stayed for 10 days till Chinese New Year eve. This place is very lively, safe, sparkling clean and convenient. Ong and Elle are very kind hosts, enjoyed my stay :)"
"Sweet space at Chinatown station. Tons of restaurants, shops and walking streets in neighborhood. 
Small room with plenty of room for my small luggage. Very clean space with a view."

"Great location, spacious room, nice design and authentic shophouse style. Friendly staff and helpful."
"When my Singaporian taxi driver dropped me off he said, ""Wow!  How did you get this place?  This is historic building - not many left!""  He said take a photo.
Place is very centrally located in a quiet area as well.  I walked most places, though, I like to walk.  Also, neighborhood is quiet."
Incredible hospitality and service! Shuying and her staff went above and beyond in kindness and generosity! I had a late night flight and they offered to allow me to relax in my room to beat the heat. This will be my go to when returning to Singapore!
House with a lot of feel-good atmosphere. Lots of shops and food places around. Recommended.

"Great location, great service and response, well appointed space for a wonderful stay.  Be sure to check out the pool and exercise room.  We were surprised at how nice The facility was and how central the location is.  About a 5 min walk to Bugis MRT and felt very safe.  Lots and lots of food and shopping so available around this location.  Don't delay, this really was a great location and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.  Btw, stayed here for 9 days in June 2019."
Host is very friendly and the response was fantastic.  Location is great and convenience.  Very recommended place to stay.
"Zoe & Friends were fantastic hosts. They were incredibly responsive and made the booking and check-in process very easy. The apartment is extremely clean and in a fantastic location, simply furnished. It easily slept 3 adults and 2 children with plenty of space and great amenities. The pool and gym were a nice bonus! I would highly recommend this apartment."
"Zoe__ place is in a really central part of town, about 10 minute taxi/grab ride from Clarke Quay - which made life really easy to get to and from places. Lots of things around the actual building as well which were really cool! Didn__ really need to contact Zoe during our stay but any time I had messaged her she was prompt at replying!

Would recommend!"

"A really clean, nice and comfortable space located in a really good area. The team was helpful in providing support when we were a little lost. They even provided chargers for our phones. But would have been great if there was a tv guide on how to surf the channels though."
Great place to stay ! The place is so clean and the location is really really awesome. Near the rochor MRT and bugis area. Very recommended _¤ï_
Great location! Walking distance to Bugis street and locale hotspots. Would stay here if we are ever in Singapore again.
Very nice location
Best value for price
This place is located very centrally. So you cannot go wrong. Place is spacious and clean. Will definitely stay again.
Clean & great place.
Thank you! Will definitely come back!
The place had plenty of room for our family of 5 and the location is spectacular.  We walked or took short cab rides to all of the sites we wanted to do.  The hosts were very helpful and attentive to our questions and requests.  Thank you for a great stay.

I had a great time at Lim and Persis' place. It is exactly as shown in the pics. The room and shower are nice and clean with natural light and ventilation. Both of them are prompt hosts who responded immediately to any queries. The beautiful kitchen and letting the guests fix their own meals is a great value add . Much recommended and thank you!
We enjoyed the peace and quiet of the neighborhood. Everything you need is also provided by the hosts.
"The room is better than in the photo and amenities such as towels,shower gels and conditioner are provided but the house is a bit far from the bus stop.So it__ not convenient for public transportation.The pool is nice and clean."
"Great place and good location, around 10 min walk to bus stop and local supermarket. Clean room and the pool was lovely. Great kitchen facilities we made full use since we are travelling and on a budget."
Lim is true being a Super host. I don__ even know how to describe my experience with his place. Me and the wife felt it was more than our home. Lim is very accommodating and always check on you to make sure you got everything you need. His place is very comfortable and cozy. We so love it! We highly recommend and will definitely book again.
"Everything was on-point. If you can afford to rent a car, please do so else a little walking to the house is not bad. Great place to stay if you want a peace of mind. Thanks"
Clean & comfy
"I've had a very great time living in Lim's house. The host is kind, caring and friendly. Also enjoy the surrounding area. Will be back when traveling to Singapore again. Highly recommended!"
Lim__ place is very clean and spacious. It__ a nice place to relax and is only a bus and train ride away from the CBD.
"Sehr sauberes und riesiges Haus, Freizeitangebote wie ein Pool oder Tischtennis ist gegeben. Die Ã¶ffentlichen Verkehrsmittel sind in 2 Richtungen leicht erreichbar sowie EinkaufsmÃ¶glichkeiten. Die Wohngegend wirkt sehr luxoriÃ¶s und Wohlhabend, da fÃ¼hlt man sich gleich wie einer der Reichen. Ich wÃ¼rde definitiv, bei einem weiteren Besuch in Singapur, zu Lim zurÃ¼ckkehren und wieder bei ihr wohnen."
"A quiet, clean, spacious and calming place to stay. Walking distance to Greenwich and close to bus stops. The whole place made us feel at ease. The host was very nice, easy to talk to and very friendly when he welcomed us. We would definitely come again! Thank you."
"The host, Mr. Lim & Miss Persis, were very informative, kind & helpful. They were patient to wait for us to arrive even if we checked-in quite late (like 2am?). Our flight was delayed. You have everything you need in this place. So much better than staying in a hotel. The room is very spacious & clean including the toilet inside. Shower pressure is good & warm. The Room is located in the second floor. No worries if you have a lot of luggages. There is an in-house lift! Uhuh, you read me right. So it makes your life so much easier bringing your luggages up & down. There are more than enough shelves to put your things on. The place is better in actual, than in the photo. Aircon is cold. Bed is comfortable. The house is big. The neighbourhood is tranquil & private. Doing laundry is free with so much space outside to hang your clothes - don__ worry, it__ safe & secure. WiFi is fast but the signal doesn__ reach the kitchen area. We love to chill by the pool side. Kitchen is spacious to move around. You might happen to see other travelers checking in too - so just be friendly and say hi. This place is Recommended!"
"This Room is very good to stay two person. And if you are okay to walk bit to Bus stop, this is very good place to stay."
"This place!!!! Its beyond expectations..Lim is a wonderful guest..responds super fast, is very helpful when you ask for suggestions and super flexible..checked us in about 5 hours before even without us requesting it.. the place is clean, beds are soooo comfortable, has a in-house lift ( yeah you read it right!) And Lim had kept shampoo, conditioner, tea, coffee and some sweets too! Check in and check out are very easy and we could go in and come out as and when we pleased. The area is very residential and 20-30 mins away from a lot of attractions including universal studios. Will DEFINITELY stay here again. Thanks Lim for making our stay super awesome!"
Highly recommended!
Nice place to stay and lovely hosts. Thanks Poh for taking care of us during the time I stayed there
"Exactly as described, very clean with all the facilities you need."
Exactly same as stated in description.
Me and my friend really enjoyed our stay. The area where the Air bnb is located is safe and really beautiful.
"Please make sure that the apartment is fully cleaned and get pictures of the sofa before you book. Apart from the above two concern, the apartment is very good and the location is very good"
The stay at Abba's place was pretty comfortable. The location of the apartment is really apt for families as Little India is just walking distance. It had all facilities which a condo can provide for a family of four.
"Abbiamo soggiornato in tre persone per poco piÃ¹ di un mese. Posizione ottima, nel giro di 15 min a piedi si raggiunge piÃ¹ o meno tutto, da luoghi di interesse a fermate della metro. Letti comodi, terrazzo molto carino. La pulizia Ã¨ da migliorare, ma in linea con gli standard asiatici. Nel complesso ci siamo trovati molto bene. L__ost Ã¨ molto gentile e disponibile"
hard communicate with the host. the appartment is good with all necessary

"The place was exactly as the photos shown.  I would say it__ not really near the mrt station as you need to walk around 12-15 mins to the nearest mrt station. Nevertheless, the place was safe and there were plenty of food options just nearby. 

My friends did not like the hair dryer as it was pretty low power and also there was no full body mirror in the house which we didn__ really like. Other than that the place was very nice and Abba suggested us to use airport pick up service when we first arrive which was an excellent idea because then we met JASON who picked us up from airport and he was super nice and friendly, he also showed us way around which was super helpful."
"Was very central. Easy 10-15 mins walk to Dhoby Ghaut MRT. , Little India MRT. Would recommend. Was cosy. We had three stay. And everything was available. Host was in contact and very helpful. Thanks for everything "
The location of the accommodation is very good and convenient to get to many places around Singapore on public transport. The apartment was clean and nice too.
The apartment is location is really close to all the famous destinations which was one of the best thing about the apartment. Rest everything was perfect and we all enjoyed and had a great time in Singapore!
Nice area
Nice place. You can take a good rest every after your long day outside. The nearest mrt station is the little india. About 5min walk.
"Cosy place that has everything.
Can see the swimming pool from the balcony which was an added bonus as can see our son.
Fridge, microwave, washing machine and dryer in excellent condition. 
Quite and very good air conditioner.
Host was a great communicator and fixed things very fast like change of light bulb or a second key set.
Really as advertised."
Great place and location. Host is very responsive! We had very good stay and highly recommend this place...
"We stayed at Abba's place for a month, it has a great location, very convenient. As we were staying for a long time - the place was a bit too small for us. Thank you for your hospitality."
"Abba's place is strategically located around 10min walk from MRT Downtown Line and the bus stop about 15mins with 7-11 & Fairprice Express right at the bus stop. Tekka Market & Tekka Place 20min walk for good value groceries. 
The unit is spacious for us a family of 3. ACs, washer drier, microwave work well and 2 queen beds help a lot. Abba was very generous with amenities such as coffee, detergent and others. 
There is a nearby park on mount Emily just behind the unit. There is even a staircase outside the gate that will lead you straight to the park. My family loved spending time there.
We love watching the squirells crossing back and forth mount Emily through our unit everyday. Living there for a month was very memorable and we would definately recommend Abba's unit to all our friends & families! Thanks again Abba!!"
Thank you for being a great host!
"Walkable distance to all Indian restaurants, mustafa shopping center,
Mrt station, bus stop and so on.
Very ideal place for Indians to stay."
"Near of everything, MRT Farrer Park Station exit F just 2 minute walk, the place is safe go home at night no problem , everyday cleaning is a plus point, shopping start at the ground floor, super market and grocery just the vicinity. Little India just 5 minute walk, Bugis 15 minute walk. Jayanthi place is busy area but quiet and safe. Love the place highly recomended."
"What is shown in this picture is exactly what you get.  Very easy to reach the location of this apartment, from the exit f farrer park MRT. 
Very communicative host, always asking small questions, to make sure we are okay.
I travel with my husband and 2 children (7yoand 3yo).  
I really recommend this place, suitable for families can cook and wash clothes.  I will return to this place, if I go to Singapore again.  thank you"
nice n comfortable place to stay for holiday trip.
"Comfortable and clean apartment, very close to MRT station and mustafa centre."
"Room is clean ,located is good easy to mrt , Owner is very kind.  "
Some miscommunication during check in causing our room wasn't cleaned prior. Had to wait an hour for cleaner to clean. But place is generally clean. However there's some unpleasant sewage smell in the living area and toilet throughout the night potentially from the drain holes. 4 adult ladies fit quite comfortably.
"Close to all important shopping centers 
Clean and spacious rooms wonderful host"
"Great host, great place, value for money. Highly recommended :)"
Sparkling clean and really near by to the farrer park mrt station.. nice
Not the best location but once inside it is good.
"Very happy with this choice. Comfortable for 2+2 family. 
Convenient to move around and for food and groceries. 
Indian Family will find it more comfortable.
Carry some napkins as they are in short supply."
"All great experience. Location, cleanliness, host quick response. Me and family had a great stay. Thank you Bella"
"Sparkling clean apartment for a good price. Entrance is next to/through a shop, but once inside is a comfortable place to stay. Pretty close to the MRT which is really useful. Stayed here with a baby, Bella kindly provided a cot and high chair. Good place to lay your head down at night as we were out all day anyway."
Really near from Ferrer Park MRT st and Bus access. Clean and helpful.
"The apartment is located close to many good restaurants and shopping Centers . The apartment itself is also spacious, clean and well (Website hidden by Airbnb) exceeded my expectations."
"this apartment is cozy and very clean. so close with MRT station and convinience store.. sometimes quite noisy at night but still can be tolerated.. bella is great host too, very welcome, kind, and quick respond."
Stayed with 3 friends and we had a good time. Great hospitality with quick responses. The apartment is nicely furnished and modern. Location close to MRT. Would recommend!
Great. As described!
"Great place! Super convenient location. Bella was a great , responsive host and everything was as expected! We really enjoyed our stay.

Also, early check in was arranged! Thank you so much!

Highly recommend!"
My favourite place ..
Comfartable room and near to MRT Station.. 
"The place was great, the picture looks bigger due to the angle, but I can say it's fairly accurate. 

There are a lot of restaurants near the place to eat. It's also conveniently close to the city. Just that there are no close bus stop, so still need to walk around 7-10 minutes"
"really great listing, super tidy and clean. definitely highly recommend"
"This place it__ great, near to MRT Station and host very friendly and kind."

"It was quite nice
Clean, good place, owner is so kindness"
"Great host, great location, very clean, quiet, absolutely worth every penny."
"There were 3 problems unsatisfied me.
The room I checked in was not the same as pictures show! You can see the living room+kitchen + sofa are right before you when the elevator door opened. It means the privacy space is just the bedroom.
I have to sleep with my friend the whole trip in the small double bed because the sofa bed in the bedroom was not balance, 1/3 of them are oblique.
I have told the landlord several days before I check in that I need 3 USB power charger and she promised make it done. But the night we go back to the apartment and found that there's no any USB power charger, sent the message to landlord and she supply 1  USB charger on the next day.
Others are very good. The room is clean, equipment is in good condition. Good location near with MRT (Remember exist from F). Very converient to go to MUSTAFA CENTRE."
"This is  a decent unit in a convenient location. It was not quite what we expected because the listing said ""luxurious, new..."" It is not a new unit, so they must mean it is a new listing. This unit is not close to new. It also is not luxurious. It is a decent place to stay. There was a significant discount, so it was a good value for the two of us. A housekeeper cleans the unit several times per week and changes the bedding and towels about every four or five days. We stayed for a month, so this was great. The host is extremely responsive. It was usually only a matter of minutes before receiving a response. One night, we returned to the unit late (around midnight) to find the internet and TV were out. I sent a note to the host, expecting a response in the morning. Instead, I received a call within minutes and the issue was resolved in less than one hour. The MRT station is literally less than a five minute walk away (for perspective on that time, we are 64 years old). One of the entrances to Little India station is a few blocks farther away, but still easy walking distance. The neighborhood is a gathering place for construction workers, especially on Sunday, but we were not bothered by the crowds. We often returned to the unit between 2300 and 0000 and were very comfortable walking from either MRT station to the unit. The City Square Mall is a short walk away (you can reach it by walking through the MRT station) and there are tons of small shops within one block. The lowest level of the building is occupied by a small shop with a very friendly owner from Bangladesh. He often had Bangladesh mangoes for sale, which are like eating sweet candy, even when green. There is a safe in the unit, but it is not bolted to anything, so we didn't use it. Since this is Singapore, we really did not have any concerns with leaving our belongings in the unit. Overall, the cleaning service was a major plus that canceled out our disappointment that it was not a new unit. We would stay again if the price is right. If there is no discount, there are units with a similar price that appear to be nicer and have more amenities, like a pool. But, if you are looking for a decent, roomy, quiet place to stay, this will work."
"Easy access location. The host is kind and quick respond. The flat is tidy and clean, and larger than expected. Stools is provided for the kids."
so nice to live here.  a little bit hard to find but so comfortable for 4people to live.
Awesome place. Excellent location right next to the MRT
Good! Clean and comfort.
I had a great stay for my three days. Location very convenient for me. Size of the unit was comfortable. I will stay there again next time I am in Singapore.
Great place to stay with family or alone.
"Alojamiento segÃºn descrito, buena hospitalidad, ubicaciÃ³n idÃ³nea, servicios en la estancia completos, recomendable."
The location is great. Close to MRT stations and city sightseeing tour pickup/drop off point. Great Indian restaurants closeby.
"The apartment has all amenities one would want while staying with family/kids. Housekeeping/cleaning is done every alternate day, and the owner and caretaker are very responsive about concerns and queries."
The apartment is very clean and spacious. The host is very quick to respond and is very accommodating. The apartment is situated in a very convenient location and is 2 mins walk to the MRT/ bus stop and close to many food outlets and shopping malls. We really enjoyed staying here and will be back soon!
"Great place to stay, esp for short term business trip like me. 
Location: Super convenient, you reach MRT around 3 mins walking. Just turn right and it's over there. You will be near City Square Mall also so dont worry about food court or shopping.
Amenities: You have everything inside. What i do love is that you will have Washing Machine and a balcony to dry your clothes. 
Quiet place: Yes, it is.
Just a bit inconvenience that you do not have many sockets to charge devices. Around 2 sockets that you may find it near your bed."
Bella is a great and helpful host
Great location in Little India. Getting back to the air conditioner was a highlight of my stay.
Great place to stay! Clean and very spacious for Singapore and only takes you a few minutes of walking to reach the metro station. Would stay here again!
"Great location, responsive host. Friendly housekeepers."
"This is a really nice spot.  It's affordable, it's near an MRT station and it's spacious.  I booked last minute because a different Airbnb rental fell through.  I was lucky to obtain this spot!  It felt homey and comfortable during my stay.  Bella was quick to respond and everything went smoothly.  It's a private and quaint spot.  Thank you Bella!"
It was a nice stay.
Bella's place is in very good location and everything is nearby. It was super helpful for me as I was staying  with a child and Puji ( staff) was extremely helpful and kind to check us in early. Would recommend to anyone looking for comfortable and affordable stay at Singapore.
"Lovely little cosy apartment in a great location within walking distance of little India, Arab street and Bugis Junction.  Efficient communication with our host and complete apartment with all the basic amenities. We found the washing machine so useful! Had a great holiday. Thank you"

"On the whole, everything was fine.  The connection to the subway is perfect and quickly accessible.  Well suited for a short stay."
"Well located property both through taxi and MRT, however being in Metropolitan area the flat is not suitable for a family with more than 3 adult members. Her local caretaker is really helpful and resourceful, must recommend property. Thanks and Cheers!"
"Absolutely lovely place. Very clean and prompt communications. Location was great too, smack in the middle of a lively street, yet date night to not be noisy. Well stocked with kitchen utensils too!"
Place was clean and check in was smooth. Thank you!
"Ailing is a great host. Communication is smooth. Bedroom and bathroom is sparkle cleaned. Good space for huge baggages. Maximum privacy. I dont mind her location as it is walkable to the bustop. I was rendered with help as it was heavy downpour, i was assisted with umbrella n baggage as i travelled with 2 young boys. This is something that exceeded my expectation. I will come back again in the future. Thank you for your kind hospitality. Best wishes."
"Nice and clean place. Affordable and well located, not too far from the city by bus."
very good place value for money.
Great value. Excellent location. The Chinatown MRT (subway) is right downstairs as is a fun retail mall and about 100 restaurant stalls to choose from.
Everything is perfect. Location is accessible to nearby MRT stations such as Little India and Farrer Park. Kitchen area where breakfast is being served is a bit small that it can go crowded if guests will eat together but not really a biggie. I enjoyed my stay and will surely come back soon!
"A good location, worth every Singaporean dollar"
"Bedste hostel jeg boede pÃ¥ i Singapore! Rent, blÃ¸de senge, enormt venligt personale og stille og vÃ¦rdi for pengene!
Hostlet ligger fÃ¥ minutters gang fra 3 metro stationer sÃ¥ nemt at tage tog frem og tilbage. Ligger i det indiske kvarter, sÃ¥ der er kun indiske butikker og restuarenter omkring"
"Best experience. Stayed at Seven for a total of 23 days. 

Goodthing: Hostel with elevator."
"So comfortable, the bed is so big and comfy, but the room is too small"
"Really well situated in the Little India, clean and functional. Recommend!"
"Good place, good price."
"Great location, affordable price, staff are very accomodating"
"cheap, basic accomodation"
Great place and great host
Amazing location and clean bunks. Having clean sheets and a heavy fresh duvet is exactly what I needed after being on the road for so long. The breakfast was a great added touch.
"I recommend 7 Wonders Hostel situated at Upper Dickson Rd, it is just 13 mins walk to Bugis Street, close to some restaurants."
Good
"Great location in the heart of Little India. The staff are great, really helpful, polite, and accommodating. The ""capsule"" bunk beds were great to give everyone a little bit of privacy and the aircon in the room was really a lifesaver in the heat. 
As far as hostels go, this one is pretty good and I would definitely recommend the shared rooms for travellers on a budget who want to stay somewhere nice, clean and with a simple breakfast included  :)"
nice room
"This is my 2nd time staying at this hostel and as always the place, the staff, the location is amazing! I highly recommend this hostel."
Really clean and neat hostel. Guests were not noisy and staff were friendly. Good value for money.
Will recommend to stay here
"It is located in little india,  i hope there is a filipino breaksfast such as rice  and the sahara room, i hope you can reconstruct the area and put the bath room inside the room. Thanks"
Great place at an affordable price
"I book 8 bedroom room for my family but I got another room, it was about 14 beds to share with others!"
"Really nice accomodation, free breakfast was a big bonus"
Good
"Very clean, very friendly!"
"Good location, about 5 minutes to the MRT. Simple breakfast area can be crowded at peak hours. Some of the other guests weren't respectful of quiet hours, but that's out of the host's hands. S$10 deposit required for locker key"
Good to sleep here
Decent hostel
Great budget place with friendly staff and breakfast
Clean and nice
"Excelente lugar, lo recomiendo 100%, es economico, y muy bonito, justo en el corazÃ³n de Little India, muy cercano a 2 MRT y con gran variedad de restaurantes para comer al rededor. Estare encantado de hospedarme ahi una vez mas cuando vuelva a Singapore. Y la atenciÃ³n del personal fue increÃ­ble tambien. Gracias"
"Great hostel if you__e here for a short stay, close to subway!"
"Positiv:
-Sehr nettes Personal 
-FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck inc.

Negativ:
-Matratze war komplett durch
-sehr hellhÃ¶rig (man hÃ¶rte den Nachrichtenton vom Personal nachts um 1 Uhr)
-SchimmelansÃ¤tze im Bad"
"Really clean, friendly staff, great location."

"Good location, very clean, respectful roommates. Only thing I wish could be better is towel rack in the room and a place to put my phone/keys in the bed cubicle."
"Great place to stay, location is perfect! Room is very clean"
"This is one of the best hostels I have stayed in. The staff are friendly and smiling, the housekeeper is very helpful, the place is absolutely clean, the bed is comfortable. The best part is there is a bathroom attached right in the room, so I don't need to walk out of the room to use toilet/ bathroom. Overall a well thought out place and arrangement. The only downside is small common area, so you can't really stay inside the hostel to do many things. Thanks for a good stay!"
"Very well stay at seven's. We had a great breakfast, shower and sleep of course."
"Overall it__ a nice place to stay with your friends. Besides, the place is about 10-15 minute walking towards 24hrs Mustafa center so you can find halal food around here."
"It__ clean, safe and near the MRT station."
It was a good accommodation. Better than I expected. With a very accommodating staffs who are willing to extend their helping hands in assisting you in your entire stay.
Everyone follows the rules nicely and that made it a great experience to live there with this higher density
Great location and amazing value for money!
The place is clean. The locket to put your belongings is large. I like that. The capsule is clean. The instructions to go to 7 Wonders given by the staff - (Website hidden by Airbnb) sooo helpful. The breakfast is good. The MRT is near. So its a good place to stay

"It__ a good place to stay, if you__e on a budget and don__ mind sharing. But it depends on your luck to have good or bad roommates, the ones I have were quite noisy and does things loud. Hence, I got woken up a few times and have trouble falling asleep. However, if you__e a heavy sleeper, then it shouldn__ be a problem."
I had a nice stay. The room has good air conditioning. Coming and going was very easy. The location was great for buses. He was flexible with my travel needs.
"Bathroom, very dirty and moldy. The place need a huge deep clean and tidy up. everything in the apartment is messy, bags and stuffs everywhere. The room was basic but could have been better, was lack of love there, not cozy like the annoucement. We do not agree he is a superhost, it is confusing people."
Amazing host! Location is accessible via bus and has very good value for the money paid.

"Location is at geylang, quite some distance from said train station. 
However host is responsive on property defect and helpful."
Good place to stay for big group of friends but not families. Actual apartment is not the same in the photo. 15min walk to MRT station. Relight district.
Nice place to stay. From aria Payoh MRT 4 bus stops and clean and tidy. It__ good to stay again.
This place is about what I expected considering the price. Our room for 6 was a lot smaller than it looked in the picture and the bathroom was really tight as well. A bit longer of a walk to the MRT than we thought but overall it was a nice place to stay for 2 nights.
"A really good location, nice bed and really good breakfast. I would totally recommend it."
"Lower deck is unexpectedly low and we cant sit straight when we stay in bed. There is only one washroom in a room and have to queue in the morning. Air-conditioning is not strong enough and it was quite hot staying in the bed with curtain closed. Breakfast is good, the staff is friendly, just the entire place is quite small and pack."
"Bon compromis pour Singapour. Un peu cher pour une auberge. Mais propre, personnel trÃ¨s sympathique, je recommande. Par contre qu__ne seule douche pour tout le dortoir."
"Great location and beds are confortable, the free breakfast was quite good"
"""7 Wonders Hostel"" is located right in the heart of Little India quarter, 10mins MRT ride from the main attractions of Singapore, such as the Marina, the Gardens by the Bay and the Botanic Gardens.
Staff members are all extremely nice, the breakfast is complimentary and I would highly recommended it to anybody visiting Singapore."
"Auberge de jeunesse trÃ¨s bien situÃ© pour visiter Singapour, il est possible de tout faire _ pied si motivÃ© !"
"Der Schlafraum war sauber, mehrere Badezimmer vorhanden"
Great place to stay!
"Nice place to stay, although it was only six places in the breakfast area which made it hard to find a place to eat breakfast. And also it would have need some more showers and toilet because our room was full and made the toilet well visited. But we love our stay anyway. Just be ready that you will arrive to Little India. But you have walking distance to centrum."
It's a nice experience.
"Very comfortable bed. This hostel does not have capsule beds as we had hoped. There are two hostels called 7 Wonders. Double check! We mistakenly went to the other 7 Wonders to check in first and were informed of our mistake there. Sadly we had already seen how good the breakfast was at the first hostel and the second just did not compare. All the basics but lacking the variety of fresh fruit. Would still recommend the hostel, nice quiet room and super comfy bed "
The apartment is amazing. It feels so much like home and sparkling clean!
Catherine__ apartment was exactly as it looks in the photos! It is in a super convenient location with a bus stop and MRT within walking distance which made getting around super easy. Catherine was also able to accommodate a late checkout on our last day which was much appreciated. Would definitely stay here again!
I will definitely come back to stay here again. Everything is perfect!
Everyone was very accommodating and did everything they could to make our stay pleasurable.  We would definitely consider this apartment again if we were to be in Singapore for another extended stay.  Anne was extremely helpful and friendly.  We could not have asked for a better host.  The apartment was very well taken care of and clean.  Had all the amenities we needed.  Thanks for making our extended stay so comfortable.
"This space was larger than I expected, very clean and modern with ample storage and a very effective washer/dryer combo. The location is a 5 or so minute walk from the nearest MRT station which we used to get to all of our activities. 

We didn__ walk around and explore too much around the residence but we did find a nice gym in under a 10 min walk nearby (where there was also a grocery store and fast food).  We would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
This is my second stay in this accommodation. I feel like home.
"The renovated one bed apartment has everything you need, and the place has been done up beautifully. Anne and Grace- a big thank-you for being so helpful and welcoming."
Great accomodation! I recommend to everybody who stay in Singapore
Excellent and modern apartment and staff very responsive.
"We LOVED our time in our newly renovated apartment at the YMCA!  Our space was perfect in all respects. 

Singapore made us feel so welcome & we had a fantastic time in this beautiful country. 

All the staff at the YMCA were wonderful.  We loved having a warm & friendly chat several times a day with a lovely man who was keeping the paths & driveways clear & clean; everyone is so proud & so respectful!

The administration staff & restaurant personnel made us feel so welcome & cared for.  We really didn't want to leave.

Thank you so much.
Tricia & David Wright"
"Sparkling clean, very stylish, central location. Awesome!!"
Highly recommended. Very clean.
Great location! So many good places to eat and train is close by.
"Everything ok, very well situated"
"I travel to Singapore quite often for work, staying in both apartments and/or hotels. I can easily say that Jay__ apartment is the best Airbnb I__e experienced in Singapore and during my time on this site. 

Sparking clean, modern and spacious, this apartment was easy to settle into. The staff was fantastic, to the point of surprising me with a birthday cake for my stay. The breakfast every morning (excl sunday) was  fantastic with your hot items cooked fresh for you. The location was only a short walk from a bus or train to take you into the CBD. 

I would definitely stay here again and look forward to doing so!"
"The best airbnb experience ever ! The host is super nice. We booked the executive studio room, but they gave us the wrong room which is standard studio, and they immediately upgraded us to the largest room. The front desk service was also incredible. You will not regret staying in this place!"
"Jay__ room was great residence.
Design, atmosphere, service, pool, rooftop were so nice for long stay.
Reception staff called taxi everyday for us with smiling anytime.

The room was cleaned up and there was a breakfast service everyday.
That was great for us!!

I will stay at the room when I go Singapore next.

Thank you!"
"Great location, easy to find for eatery and close by to the mrt as well."
Staff at the front desk is incredibly helpful.
"Flawless on all counts and fantastic value for Singapore. Jay's offering beats all other short term accomodations options so if that's what you're looking for, look no further!"
"I promise this isn't a spam review - my girlfriend and I thought this place wasn't real. The pictures online look photoshopped even. To our surprise, we arrived to a place that was exactly as advertised: clean, stylish, and cheap. We were treated with a massive complimentary breakfast buffet every morning by the sweetest aunti and uncle in the dining area. The location was perfect for us, as my family (and just about everything else) was a 5 minute taxi ride away, literally. It feels like a leap of faith as a foreigner to rent this place, especially due to the taboos of AirBNB in Singapore, but I promise this was legit and it is definitely a spot we would love to come back to in a future visit."
It was fantastic place. I will visit here again. Definitely recommend to all this hotel is an excellent.
"__¸¸__ï½¤æ__¡é_å¸¸å¥½,å¹²å__´æ_!"

Really nice place to have a short getaway

"Wonderful and quiet place.Front office staff manager Alex kept asking me how was my stay when we met at the lobby.He acknowledged by my feedback on some defects lightings and door to bathtub area.It was A Surprise to me that he arranged for the contractor came in evening and to fix (Website hidden by Airbnb) was totally Magnificent place, cleanliness and close by to malls, eateries and public transport too.I will definitely return to the residence on my next visit.Thank you, Alex and Team..."
Beautiful space by wonderful host!
Nice place with not bad size
Awesome place!
"The staff are amazing. From the friendly receptionist who always help me with my wheelchair and the cook who ask if we don__ have breakfast. 
It close to malls and mrt. And close to major hospitals. 
But the road to the hospitals is not wheelchair friendly as I would hope."
"The apartment is very conveniently located, just a short walk to the malls. It is quite clean, and amenities are great. If you're looking to spend some quality time with your loved ones, this is a good choice. Amenities in the room allow you to bake, cook, soak in the tub, watch tv while you laze in bed!"
Great
Clean apartment in semi mediocre location - close to transport links and food - building work going on next door to be aware of noise very early in the mornings
Spacious and spotlessly clean. Filled with various small amenities like shower gel; shampoo. Excellent TV box to surf different worldwide channels. Covered swimming pool in new development. Centrally located to major transportation nodes and numerous food legends in Balestier. Enjoyed our stay very very much. Suitable for family of 4. Host is very friendly and obliging. I highly recommended Tina!
Cosy and comfy place :-)
"Arun is a pleasant host. He attendsto every need even to the simpliest details. 

The place is very accessible. There's a bus  stop less than a minute walk from the building and a hawker center too, very convenient."

"Nice stay with good amenities. Very stylish and a clean room with clear idea what the room wants to represent. Good public transportation near the apartment. T S was a very good host, he had good recommendations for what you can do in Singapore, too."
"TS, is a great host with great place. Walking distance MRT Station, clinic on the same building, small hawker is just on the other side of the road. The only problem we had was slow internet connection."
"Nice place, near the train station (5min) witch is very practical. Nice host. Replies quickly and very helpful. The room has everything you need."
"Excelente  well located close to all facilities
Recomendo aos brasileiros que viagem para Singapura"
"We had a wonderful time at TS__ place. He was kind enough to pick us up from the airport at 6am for a $20 fee. The location was fantastic. Really close to the delicious Hawker Centre and a 10 min door to door walk to the train station. 10 min train ride into the city for $1.90 each way (although if you__e there long enough and use the trains, you can get a tourist pass which works out even cheaper)
It was about half an to the airport including one easy change of line for just $2.40. All train tickets can be bought from the stations using both cash and card on the machines. There are ATMs at the station too. 
The apartment itself was great. Clean, tidy, comfy bed. Plenty of space. Washing machine and air con were a god send! Make sure you know where the hot water switch is before being left to your own devices! Super safe place- late night entrance and all lift use is only accessible using the swipe card. We definitely recommend this place!!"
"The apartment looks very small in the photos but is bigger than you think  It is close to the MRT and lots of buses available in the area too. A great place to stay. Clean. Quiet and perfectly formed 
We would recommend this place to anyone looking for a private place with everything you need in the local area or just a bus or train away. 
A great place and a great host "
Strong recommended
Thank you for being a great host and make my trip fun. Your place is bigger than in the picture. Also clean and easy to access by mrt and bus.
"TS was a great host and the place is nicer than the photos show. The building was very secure and clean, a strange mix of small business/office spaces and converted apartments. TS's place is on the 'business' side of the floor, with no one in the spaces on either side of the flat. The other two spaces on our side of the building were not noisy businesses at all and did not disturb us in any way. The other side of the building is clearly all residences. The shower got nice and hot, with excellent water pressure, the washing machine was very good, as was the AC and the mattress. The location is near a variety of food options and very near an MRT station and a couple of supermarkets for snacks/toiletries if needed.

My only issue is with AirBnB, not TS's place. I did not realize that short-term leasing (less than 3 or 6 months) is illegal in Singapore. There may be some exceptions by building type or otherwise, but I'm no lawyer. I assumed it was like South Korea, or Japan, which have licensing and my quick research turned up that it was okay to stay in Singapore. As far as I can tell from more careful research, it is a $15,000 USD fine to the host, but currently no enforced penalty for guests. I have no idea why anyone would risk this penalty. Since it is becoming clear that AirBnB is not taking any responsibility in ensuring local legal compliance, my feelings about using AirBnB in Singapore are entirely my fault for not checking more carefully. TS was very upfront about the whole thing and the flat is very nice. If you are okay with the general situation and comfortable with the risks, I think this place is a good choice to stay. I have had to navigate a few sketchy interactions in Asia and this stay was nothing like those experiences.

I am not comfortable lying to neighbors or immigration (although no one asked us any questions, including security at the building entrance) but I also would not want to cause someone that level of fine. It does not seem that the building is the type of complex that bans short term stays (like some condo associations in larger cities), but it's a small building and I can see that neighbors might have concerns about random strangers coming and going. For this reason, I would have chosen a different type of stay in Singapore for my own peace of mind. If AirBnB were legal, I would recommend this host and stay 110%."
The stay was enjoyable and we didn't face any issues
"Great place. Bigger than it looks in pictures. Vey clean. Close to public transport, small hawker center, shops etc. T.S was an amazing host. He picked us up from the cruise port, made check in a breeze, and was always available to answer questions. He was very thoughtful and flexible. We would stay again in a heartbeat."
TS's place  is close to the Eunos MRT station and food stalls. It is clean and bigger than the picture shown. We will certainly stay there again.
"Place is clean and bigger than on the pictures.
Would stay there again."
The place looks much better in the photos. Host is friendly and nice. Would love to come back.
"Overall, great place. Close to transit, clean, spacious, quick communication from host."
Nice place. Very near to train station.
"Tolles Apartement, alles da, was man benÃ¶tigt, Busstation und U-Bahn in unmittelbarer NÃ¤he.

Nice
Sam has been responsive and was very attentive. Will definitely return.
"Great stay at Megan's place. The room was really comfortable and Megan and Ben were very welcoming and helpful. The room is very close to food places, a supermarket/mall and lots of buses. Megan was very responsive to messages and very helpful all during my stay. The condo has a gorgeous pool which was lovely to take a dip in. Would really recommend a stay here."
"The condo has many facilities that makes it a relaxing and cosy stay. Close to bus stop and there's a mall with food options too.

Megan is a friendly host who is able to chit chat with like a friend but still respects the privacy of guests despite staying in the same home."
"Staying with Megan was like staying with a friend in another city. She was friendly and lovely. Communication was easy and she offered us great tips. Amenities were thoughtful and the space was stylish and modern. Grear conversation too. 

Thank for hosting us. If we are coming back we will definitely stay with you. 

Xx"
"Megan and Ben are super responsive and very easy-going. Checking-in goes smoothly and the hosts are very welcoming. The apartment, including private bedroom and bathroom are very clean and comfortable, and the pool is a great addition to the package. If you have time left, you might want to try the steam rooms and the gym, or do the tree top walk that's near the complex. All in all I can say this has been my best Airbnb experience so far, so I would definitely recommend this place to everyone."

"Kim__ place is at a perfect location, very easy to get around with public transportation and walking distance to awesome bars and restaurants. Her place is great, very clean and has everything you need. Kim was also very helpful since the beginning, available at all times whenever I had any questions. Totally recommend it."
"The host of this place - Megan and Ben - are very nice, hospitable, polite and considerate. We were kindly welcomed, thoroughly hosted and thoughtfully seen off. The host provided us with every household thing we needed and all amenities were very good: clean and private bedroom/ bathroom, washing machine, space for drying clothes and shared kitchen/living room. Furthermore, the railway station is only 5 minute walk away and convenice store (7/11) and fastfood restaurant are all around. Our experience was so complete. This is a great place to consider staying at when you travel to Singapore!"
"Love your cosy apartment  n room so comfortable .
Thank you to Megan n Ben . We did have great time holiday in Singapore . thank you so much . will be back here one day !!!"
Good!
I love the place! Thanks Megan and Ben!
"Not only are Megan and Ben welcoming hosts but also they are helpful ones. Future guests can get tips from them on how to go about their area.

Their place is very homely, and the guests' room is specially cozy. Our 6-day stay at their place was, all in all, a splendid experience. Thanks a lot, Megan and Ben!"
"Megan and Ben are really very nice and helpful. They make you feel like at home) No noisy in the apartment, quite place in the beautiful condominium. Swimming pool and area are excellent!"
"5 days stay with my wife,  better than what I expected.  Quite,  calm!  and other facilities are  Very friendly and helpful hosts. Will love to be there if we came to Singapore again."
"Our stay at Megan__ apartment was great. The room was a little small for two adults with big bags but Ben and Megan were never home, so it was as if we had the entire apartment to ourselves. Everything was provided for us, the WiFi was super fast, the apartment was close to the bus stop and in a very quiet and local area. Megan and Ben were so accommodating and even kind enough to let us stay longer, free of charge. We will definitely stay here again. Thank you Ben and Megan for a pleasant stay!"
"Everything was perfect! Megan and Ben are great hosts and have us some additional tips for Singapore. You should definitely check out Megan__ restaurant birds of a feather, the dinner was delicious!!"
"Lovely location. It is easy to get around by Bus or Metro.
Great communication with Megan.
We felt very well."
"The bed and bath are both well kept, easy Check-in and out because of the automatic door lock and the hosts respond quick for clarifications and concerns.

Ameneties are also of good quality and the neighborhood is peaceful.

Great place to stay in overall."
"We really enjoyed our stay at Megan and Bens lovely place. 

They were so hospitable and kind and gave us really good tips to make the most of our stay in Singapore. 

The apartment was perfect for a couple and the location is in a quiet neighbourhood with really good transportations. 

Thank you Megan and Ben! _ï¸__ï¸"
"Megan and Ben were really kind and helpful in all what we as travellers needed. The place is clean, check-in and out with the automatic door lock is easy, the separate bathroom is just opposite the guest bedroom and clean as well. There are plenty of food options neraby with the local MRT in a walk distance. The accomodation is very cosy and quiet, the swiming pool is perfect after the warm day. And Megan and Ben always responded immediately to all of our needs according the appartment. Thank you both, you are amazing!"

I can recomend this place
It is a nice room at great location. Close to MRT Novena station.
"Even though the listing is located a bit far from the center, it is not hard to get to the center. The listing itself is very good."
Nice cosy place very quite for u to rest and relax
"Quick replies and always contactable. Pleasant stay, hate to leave the place."
"Jay__ service apartment was just the perfect place for a small family get away. We were urgently looking for a place for a week__ stay and grateful that Jay and his team accepted our booking the night before and provided the check-in details as soon as they could. The apartment is well furnished, we could make small meals for ourselves and our baby girl. And there was also availability of a baby chair for her meals. The lounge which was open all day around had coffee and tea provided, which was a nice touch. definitely recommended!"
"The residence is worth the value, nice and comfortable place to stay.The staff given the warm welcome upon check in and good hospitality given by the staffs working there. The environment feel like staying in a hotel.Will go back again to stay."
Highly recommend this airbnb its my second stay here will come back here again. Very quite place and near to town area
Nice and Spacious
A very good place to stay alone or with family; the place is clean and nearer from shopping center and train or bus station
"Good place to stay, near to all shopping places and indian and Chinese resturants. Child friendly, would recommend to anyone with or with out kids. Very quiet at night time......Good for sleeping."
#NAME?
"A comfortable and affordable place to stay, in a good location walking distance to Farrer Park MRT. While the accommodation was basic and ground floor entrance area less than impressive, the bed and living area were fine for a short stay. 

The main door lock was not working and required a long time to open and close during the first few days. The host was very responsive throughout the stay and replaced it with a new digital lock which made a big difference. This was appreciated.

With a bit more attention to detail and a more thorough cleaning, this would a very good place for couples wanting to explore the great eateries and sights nearby."
Great place to stay.
"Our stay at the Farrer Suites was fine. Elise is a completely off-stage character but she has a very pleasant __elper_ on the premises (Nila) who helped when needed.  Elise also responds very quickly to comments and requests. 

The good side of the studio (#3) is that it__ clean, quiet (some people from across the alley talk late into the night, but it__ just talking and not unpleasant) and adequate for the job. The AC works fine, which is crucial in this hot town, but the kitchen is hardly a kitchen. One old hot plate, a microwave and a mini fridge. A toaster and a coffee maker would have been welcome. That being said we had a good time and Singapore being a food city we didn__ really expect to do anything but have breakfast there, which we managed to do. 

The wifi was quite weak but  Elise seemed ready  to fix it."
"The room is nice, clean and huge. Will return for a stay in future if needed. "
So clean and much more spacious. I like also the privacy.
a little dark. air con position is very odd. didn't really feel cool when sleeping

Good.
"I stayed in the Airbnb with a group of 4 students for a program at NUS. The location is farther from the ""downtown"" area, but very conveniently located above a shopping mall which has many places to eat and shop for groceries/convenience store goods. There is a taxi stop downstairs which is also very convenient.

The condo was sparkling clean upon arrival and was clean during the weekdays, which was a very helpful touch. The condo also has a pool area, which we used many times. Check in and check out was very easy as the condo management in the lobby was very friendly and hospitable. The condo had everything we needed and was very comfortable."
Great place. Great location. Great amenities. Angie was quick to respond to our queries before we checked in. Overall a great place for families and it's attached to a mall.

"Perfect location, gorgeous staff. We recommend this hotel for these reasons."
"It was a good stay. The convenience store was right in the plaza. The views outdoors was very nice. Good serviced apartment. We look forward to come here again. Thank you, Angie"
"Angie is a great host , very quick response to all my concerns and questions. The apartment was huge and clean and in a very good location. It was connected to small mall where you can do your shopping and grocery. Housekeeping service were provided 3 times a week. I will stay again at Angie__ place if I get back to Singapore again. Thank you Angie you are super star host."
Great central location! Rooms are small but the beds are comfortable. Be sure to check out Maxwell hawker center!!
"Small rooms. 
Dark carpet and floors"
"Great location, small
 It clean room. Very helpful."
The room was quite small (smaller than I had expected) but I think that__ pretty much how it goes in Singapore. Overall really good stay in a really great area
"Really great location in Chinatown. However the room is INCREDIBLY small. I wouldn__ recommend staying here with any more than an individual traveller. My friend and I barely had room for our bags in the room, and moving around the room is difficult. But it was generally clean, the hotel changed our sheets once in our stay."
ä½__°é_å¾_¾¿_ _¿é__©å____
The location is good and easy to find yet the room is too small and we couldn__ open our luggage even on the floor.
"Kelvins space is perfectly located by Chinatown and right next to the train station. Stylish and clean space, enjoyed my stay here."
My partner and I had a great time in Singapore. The room was perfectly located in the heart of Chinatown despite its small size. It was clean and perfectly served our purposes. The receptionists were very welcoming.
Easy check-in. Best place to get relative to price. Location can't be beat. Many local eateries and public transpo nearby.
Overall is was quite good just that the room was too small but the photo feel is not however I personally feel that the place is not worth the value.
"Paridhi__ space was clean and very central to town, which I loved. The local MRT station was right next door. She was quick to respond to messages and there was a weekly linen service which was amazing for a four week stay."
Very helpful host
It__ fine for backpackers.
Good location. Five minutes walk from the Clark Bay train stations.
"Unfortunately this was the worst AirBnB and/or hostel stay in my month in South East Asia and really ever. Don__ get me wrong it was not terribly filthy or anything, and I imagine it__ be ok for others, but it just did not work our well for me.  My issues were:

- check-in was 2pm, I killed time from my AM flight at Jewel at the airport and was thrilled to arrive around 1:45, thinking I__ timed it perfectly. At check-in they casually said something like __ell check-in is 2 but your room won__ be ready until 3 or 4 because of misting_. I had no idea what this meant, but said __K if you could just let me know the moment it is ready because I__e only had two hours sleep and I__ exhausted_, and that I__ be waiting on the TV area. Even though there was AC in the lobby and kitchen area someone had opened all the windows in this area, so the AC wasn__ effective and it was quite hot n stuffy, I sat for almost two hours reading and trying to stay awake and finally around 3:40 went over and asked if my room might be ready soon...and they promptly took me to it. So it was ready. And no one bothered to tell me. Had it been ready an hour? 30 minutes? Who knows!
- The room was honestly like a little prison cell. The AC and fan were super drying and cement walls and not enough room for your bag, and opening the door at the same tkme and....ugh, it was just not pleasant to be there at all.
- the halls and bathrooms are not air conditioned and are therefore SWELTERING, I__ get a fresh sheen of sweat on after showering, just by stopping to brush my teeth
- the staff weren__ helpful or friendly. Many of the guests were Chinese and it seemed they were a bit more social in Mandarin, but who knows. The only time a staff member addressed me was to yell at me for having shoes on in the kitchen (I thought the halls and bedrooms and bathrooms were shoe free, but the lobby living room and kitchen were not since new guests checking in and such didn__ remove them). At the moment I was being yelled at there was another guest sitting 2 feet away in his shoes, but I guess he didn__ count ___ï¸
- was there breakfast? I don__ know I didn__ receive any info about it and there were no signs or detail posted except one near the toaster saying __o not put butter or jam on toast before toasting_  I never bothered to ask about it because the cornflakes and shelf stable milk I saw didn__ look worth the effort 
- Overall I was just disappointed as I rely on hostels in part to provide some social interaction, and there was none (ppl only talked to who they came with), and ideally a bit of guidance about the city, hell even the basics like using public transport, were also not available. 

By the way __isting_ was in reference to once/month bug spraying. I get it, it__ Chinatown, it__ necessary, just wish the communication had been more clear on this, or they did it at a different time of day.

To note I also had a bad cold during my 2 nights here, not sure the horrible AC owing directly in my face caused it, or if I already had it and it made me feel worse, but I do know this colored my experience, so my shit time should perhaps be taken with a small grain of salt :)"
"Room only fits a bed, claustrophobic, no towel."
"If you want somewhere within the city/downtown, this can be an option."
With this price it's not bad.
All that mattered to me was good location - and this checked that box.
"Overall not bad. Room quite ok with comfortable bed and blanket provided. Breakfast is also provided with some toast, jam, milk and cereals. But the ""all day toast"" as mentioned is not true as we are not allowed to have those toast for our supper. The corridor cleanliness can be improved. However the host will reply any of your enquiry through private message. The best thing was it's strategic location where only a few walks to the nearest Chinatown mrt station."
"Good location, Good price"
"Great location, check in was smooth. Aircon worked well.  Place was great for a short stay, even with two kids. Cons - much smaller than anticipated and mattresses were thin, sank in the middle a little. Would likely stay again purely for ease of location."

"James was a kind and friendly host, he was always there to help if needed. The place was terrific and it met my all needs."
"James was an awesome host, doing everything he could in order to make my stay the best possible. Would always come back and can only recommend renting his apartment as the communication is easy and the apartment is located very good!"
"I had absolutely great time staying at Jame__. Everything is exactly as what I had hoped for. Clean apartment with full amenities, perfect location - extremely easy to commute (very short walk to MRT and bus stops). Very nice neighborhood for short and extended stays. Food is easy to find. Would highly recommend to anyone who is checking this place out."
Good place great spot
"Nice landlord, the room is very clean and cozy, we slept very comfortable, the location is near Arab street, near railway station(bugis station), easy to find, nice experience, we evil come again."
"The location is convenient as the train station (Bugis Downtown Line) is just a few minutes walk away, there__ food everywhere (Ah Chew Desserts is also literally a few minutes walk away, it__ a famous local dessert shop)  and the malls are nearby too! 

The bathroom provides all you need to clean yourself after sweating in Singapore__ hot weather and eating all the nice food.

The kitchen provides little tea time stuff and drinking water. Oh my personal fav is that they have a washing machine, you can wash your clothes if you want to. 

(I was in room #1)
And your room....Overall room size is rather small but is not really an issue. It__ clean, the aircon is cold as heck, the bed is a single size but has a pull-out mattress underneath it, you have a wardrobe, a dressing table and another small table with two chairs and a hair dryer. The wifi can get rather slow and it disconnects by itself sometimes. (Might just be my room)

A great place to stay and a great alternative if you couldn__ find an AirBNB within town area. (Orchard/Dhoby Ghaut)"
"Lucinda's place was very nice and organised,clean and with great interior deco....Very spacious and comfortable....She is a very Kind person and very helpful...I will definitely be back!"
"Beautiful place, amazing location and superstar host Lucy. Thank you for all, I have had a peaceful stay. I even managed to do yoga in the room which is big enough for a yoga mat. Yeah!"
"This was my first airbnb experience, so I didn't know what to expect. I fell in love at the first sight when I saw the photos of Lucinda's place and hers was of the cheaper ones. The lack of reviews (only one at the time) made me hesitate, but in the end I decided to give it a go.

It didn't disappoint; the room was nice and cozy, her attention to details was amazing, there were a lot of food stalls around the apartment, and it was close to Bugis MRT station. Oh, and did I mention the nice massage chair? It was great after a long walk. If I have to criticize something, I think 1 bathroom for 5 or so guest rooms was a bit lacking.

Thanks for your hospitality, Lucy. Will definitely consider your place if I go to SG again."
"The place is better than I expected, it__ very clean and comfortable, there are lots of famous street foods. Lucinda is such a great host, she helped me a lot. I would love to recommend this place."
We had a wonderful staying at Lucy's place. The best location in Singapore! Just 2mins walk to metro. My room is really cosy but a bit small if you don't have too much stuff you will be fine. Everything was so perfect. You have to manage time to use a bathroom sometimes because you have to share with other guests.
"_¿æ___¸¸nice,_°é_å¾_¥½,___å¾__é¬§å__¢æ____å¾__!"
"Very good location and cozy place. 
Good hosting and kind staff. 
Everything is in the room such as shampoo and hair dryer. 

Thank you"
A nice place!
Great place!
"This place was superb. The only downfall is the lack of enough toilets. Don't worry. It's still super worth it! I love the massage chair that you can use after a long tiring day. The place also have everything you'll need.. adaptors, fresh blanket, fresh towels, tea and coffee. Really looking forward to my next stay here! :)"
"Location is good. Convenient store and restaurant (if you love hot pot) is walking distance. Room is clean and comfortable. Unfortunately we have a damaged bedding that caused us a pain to sleep. Internet speed is good. Common bath room is clean at all time. Kitchen is with drinking water. Due to the room is facing main road, there is noise from vehicle passing through occasionally. Anyway, it__ worth to have a stay because of its location and cleanliness."
"Everything was great! There is a massage chair as well, which is perfect when you've been walking around Singapore all day."
Thankyou!
"Nice clean room, comfy bed, nice host!"
Very lovely stylish comfortable room. Shared toilet was also clean and room its quiet. The best thing here is Lucinda is very helpful and response quickly to messages which helped alot.
Incredible convenient location and helpful host.I feel like home when I stayed here. Thank you 
"Lucinda's place is almost perfect. The bedroom I had was spotless clean. She was right in  choosing white for everything. The communication from Lucinda was great. The location was great, with proximity to the MRT, shopping, eating out."
very good
Great host will make ur stay a comfortable one her place is very central near mrt and market. Neat and clean place with amenities Very conveniently placed
"Lucinda place is very good. Near by mrt. Easy way to go anywhere. So many place for nice food.
 Lucinda also very nice and friendly. Recomended place for staying in singapore. Thank you Lucinda"
Great value for money and extremely well located. Just be aware that there is only one bathroom for 5 rooms which becomes very busy in the mornings and evenings.
Homely feel :) A great place to stay that's value for money!

"Lucinda is truly a super host - she will find the answer to any question you might have and she knows everything there is to know! Her place is in a great location, everything is easily accessible, and it is perfect for lone travellers and families alike. 
I would definitely recommend to anybody travelling to SG - thanks so much!"
"Perfect stay in a strategic position, I can recommend it :D!"
Je rejoins les autres commentaires adresse proche du mÃ©tro bugis mais une salle de bain pour 5 chambres c est juste !
"It was my first time to travel to Singapore though, I had a great time in my trip. Lucinda__ place has a great location and is very comfortable."
"I love the location and it's very clean, recommended for you guys who want travel around Bugis and doing business around Suntec city."
Room is clean and location is great.
Thanks so much for giving us early check in and late check out. Nice location for travel.
"The location is great! So close to many good sights, but far enough away, that it__ not a busy area. The apartment was stylish. Just note, there is only one shared bathroom, not two. Bathroom gets very busy in the morning and in the evenings. But the amenities were great. One thing to note, however, there is construction going on across the street. When we were there, in October 2019, it looked like the construction was just beginning. It__ out of Lucinda__ control, but it__ still there. And they were working overnight. (even though they aren__ supposed to!!) It was very noisy, and prevented my husband and I from getting a good night__ sleep. Again, I know it__ out of Lucinda__ control, but I just want to make sure other guests are aware."
Great host! Location is near in the MRT station. The place is perfect for travelers.
"Recommend! The host is very responsive and tries to help you out if needed. The space is very clean and simple. You can use the amenities like the fridge, water boiler and even their massage chairs! The location is really convenient, a 2 min walk to Bugis junction and a few minutes walk to Suntec city. There is a whole street of food just below this place as well! And the vibe is superb. Love it."

Friendly and thoughtful host. Recommended to people out there
Jay is very easy to communicate. The apartment is sparkling clean and close to malls and mrt
"Great location to get to the fancy area.
The bakuteh restaurant in front of this hotel was awesome."
"Conventiently located, well maintained little capsule hotel downtown. Rooms are clean, a/c well regulated. Breakfast very basic, but included. 

Good for few nights stay if no fuss is needed."
Really great place in an awesome location. The staff was super helpful and accommodating. They helped me get a taxi and allowed me to store my stuff in a locker on my last day after I checked out. I came back super sweaty and gross and didn__ want to board my flight all the way to the states unclean so they lent me materials to take a shower before I took off. Really hope I come back and get to stay with them again!
"The walls and doors are paper thin so it's very noisy, but otherwise clean and well situated. A good value for money if you have ear plugs ^^"

The capsule private room is like a bunk bed and you can choose to have the top or bottom side in your room. It is small but really clean and in a great place to explore Singapore. Free tea and coffee all day were appreciated!
"Singapore has lots of capsule hotels. This one puts you right by the river canals and not far from museums/Chinatown, which is nice. I went with one of the ""private rooms,"" a double bed with a bit of stand-up space. Honestly I've enjoyed regular capsules more (I've stayed at a couple other locations in town). You have another double bed right above/below you, and the stand-up space is so tight it's hardly an advantage for the price in my opinion. Location is good. Nice seating area that not all capsules have. Staff were nice."
Lovely stylish hotel with perfect location! Space is limited but privacy is promised.
Very clean and spacious
"Thanks for your quick response all the times, it was perfect the stay there. :)

Regards 
Monica & Camilo"
OK
It is the same as in the picture. and good for budget travellers. washing machine and detergent are free.
The location is just in the centre of city. It's so strategic and near the MRT station. Love the house so much
"It was a quite nice stay here. It__ not really a private flat, it__ more like a hostel, cause there are more than one room and other travelers. 
It__ very close to the Mrt litte India what is good. 
Our room wasn__ sparkling clean because we had some hair on the floor , in the shower and on the towel on the floor in front of the shower. Additionally we had some ants close to the sink in the room. 
Except these points it was really nice and comfy! The communication with the host is easy and there__ allways someone there to help!"
Bon logement avec un super emplacement ainsi que Diane qui est trÃ¨s rÃ©active aux messages !
"The room is clean, the bed is big and comfortable, good air-conditioning, everything is as in the description. Room is realatively small with spacious shower cabin though. There is a small window above the bed which comes the light from at night, it is covered by a curtain but you can notice the light anyway, it may be disturbing if you like to fall asleep in the dark. Toilets are next to the kitchen. The location is convenient, 5 minutes to little India metro station. The host's employee is very helpful. Overall we were satisfied with the place, it has everything you need and the price was very good."
Great location. Close to Little India train station. Friendly neighbourhood and quiet area.
"The place was close to little india MRT, easy access to everywhere. The room isnt too small, we also got private shower room! they gave us room sandals and also towels. Thankyou diane and anabel . would definitely stay here again."
"+: location; helpful host and her assistant; room is Ok for it's price
-: combined kitchen and toilets area; rooms are close to the kitchen/toilet and noise from that area is quite loud; lights from the street 
In general, considering the price and location it is a good option, but I wouldn't stay there second time"
"Fair and easy place to stay with a great host and helpful stuff in the building. It is really close to the Marina area, so you safe a lot of time for the main tourist things to do and see."
no recomendado
Great place very near to MRT and very peaceful.
"Great location, super close to the station (only a few minutes walk), rooms were comfy and felt private, just as you would expect."
"Diane's place is near bugis and rochor, so it's the best decision to live there if you love to go there. Anabel (her assistant) was also helpful. Too bad there were some guesses who made a lot of noise when it's late night. Overall, her place is a good catch."
"Clean place, everything worked well. Location is super convenient!"
Value for money. Great location! Anabel is so sweet and very responsive. Thank you for the great stay! Will definitely stay again when we come back SG.
"Great location in CBD!
Great stay!
Great assistant!
Great communication!
Every things are great!!!"
Good stay and good location in CDB. Friendly assistant to take care house. Highly recommended!
Location is great in CBD. Easy accessible to MRT and eateries are nearby. There is an assistant to take care the house. She please to clean up the room.
Repeated stay. Excellent place (CBD) to go tourist attractions. Eateries around the area. Mrt is nearby with 3 to 5 minutes walking.

The place is very near the mrt! Good location for its price. Thanks ms diane!
"Place is nice and cozy, not too far from Little India MRT, but also not too closed. Shower inside the bedroom and toilet is outside. Will come again lqter for next visit."
Great place for travellers looking for an affordable bed.
"Diane's place is in a good location of Little India. Just a short ride on the mrt can bring you to the marina, Chinatown and all the Hussle and Bussle. There is plenty to do around the area and there is someone on site to help out if there is anything you need."
Diane's room is located in Little India. Great to discover the city easily.
There is smell of mold a little. But the other things are good.
"Cena versus lokalita je ok. Sprcha na pokoji, wc spole_nÃ©. Å½Ã¡dnÃ¡ snÃ­dan_, vybavenÃ¡ spole_nÃ¡ kuchy_ k dispozici. DobrÃ¡ komunikace."
A Nice place at a perfect location to explore Singapore!
"The place is in a nice neighbourhood, supermarkets and a food court very near. It's easy to get to the city center and to the main sights by MRT. Plus walking around in Little India is nice too. I found it strange that the kitchen and toilets are practically in the same room. The private shower in the room was nice though."
Great value
SÃºper cool
Great location for getting around Singapore. Very safe neighborhood. Loved having a shower in our room. Very minimal but did the trick for a couple of nights stay.
Simple rooms but just what you need for a couple of nights in the city. Super clean! Host answers fast and really helpful. Self-check in really easy

Value for money.
"Nice place to stay. Middle road nearby had nice places to drink, eat and walking distance to malls"
Value for money
"Everything is just as pictured _ very stylish and clean. Staff is friendly. Breakfast is simple and light, cereal and toast with toppings. There__ a coffee machine with various drinks (cappuccino, mocha, etc.) That were tasty. 
There is a bit of noise, but if you__e a city person or traveler accustomed to shared spaces, it__ not a problem at all. 
Bathrooms and all the spaces were very clean and comfy. 

Travel Bonus: there__ also an unaffiliated but cool speakeasy restaurant and cocktail bar hidden behind the modest chicken & rice place nearby the entrance. Ask to make a reservation, then you can go into a secret tunnel behind the beer fridge for a delicious meal and drinks (that will cost about as much as a night__ stay)."
"Capsule Hotel is one of the coolest places I__e stayed. In the heart of everything, the place was super cozy and comfortable. I would totally look forward to staying here again!"
__¸¸å¥½æ§ä»·æ¯__
The hostel is a brand new and very stylish. The capsule is very comfortable and gives a privacy. 30 mins walking to downtown or 7 mins walk to Raffles Place station. There are a lot of cafes and restaurants nearby . Highly recommend !
Thank you! Very nice location and stylish hostel! Clean as well 
Surprisingly good experience here. I hesitated to book a capsule but slept very well (with earplugs). Being in the city centre made up for the proximity to other guests and the inconvenience of a top bunk (a bit difficult to get into). Price still high for a capsule but that__ Singapore.
"Comfortable bed and good shower! Like the hot beverage machine. A bit noisy with the nearby bars and karaoke places, but if you don't mind this is a good place for the value."
"As still new in Facility and amazingly cleanliness all over.  and good location, convenient to access to center of City. 
Thankfully, I could sleep surprisingly deeply... It is so unique to close the capsule room's individual door. and keep completely private space so that no noice and no light from outside. 
Only the thing, some one leave a lot of water around basin in shower room.  need to fix this issue.."
"The Hotel is very New and Clean. Managed to have a tour around. As what the advertisement, it is Indeed very clean and comfortable to stay. Don__ have any issue, except be very careful when booking the hotel through Airbnb.

I have booked through Airbnb for one night. Upon checking in at the reception, realised that particular room booking is for female only. Tried contact host + (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , to see if there__ any other way to do a swap or a partial refund. That night the mixed room is totally full and i have no choice but to rebook other hotel, having stuck with all these for 4-5hrs, cannot do anything. 

Airbnb customer service were helpful and believe that I should at least get a partial refund from the host. Till now i have just wasted this booking without any refund and stay in the hotel. The Airbnb customer service manager then follow up very closely and had made a decision on his part to refund me 50% of my paid room. I really appreciate his help and decision!

Please be advised not to book from Airbnb. You can try (Website hidden by Airbnb) or Agoda web, this is more secured if you need any help, rather than turning to Airbnb Host whereby not a single message and/or call despite __ead my messages_. This is also confirmed by the hotel reception that the Host mostly is unresponsive if you need any help for the accommodation related, reception told me many past history of customers overlooked the booking to female only room during booking . 

Plan wise and don__ make the unnecessary mistake as me agin!"
Capsule is great! If you haven't tried it I would recommend it.
äº¤é_½±ï½¸ï½¾ï½½â_
"I extend one night but front desk women said that you have to have confirmation number.. staff told me that already fully book so you have to contact airbnb.. Are you serious? If sold out, you have to block your system.. so terrible.. I never go there"
"With it being my first time staying in a hostel, I don__ have much to compare it to, but I imagine it was on the better end of the spectrum. It was clean. The staff was nice. The location is great. The room was quiet during my stay. Plenty of girls were there__hey were respectful and seemed to keep to themselves. I__ highly recommend it to any solo female traveler!"
"The location is great, very near main tourist attractions (all in walking distance) and several MRT stations. The staff were helpful and friendly. The bathroom was clean, but the quilt cover had hair on it and the air in the capsule did not seem very fresh. It was not very comfortable to breathe when sleeping at night since I had allergic rhinitis. Overall it was worth the price."
Bunk beds are totally sealed from each other(giving much privacy). Location convenient and close to bars.
"I really enjoyed my stay here! I was traveling solo and this was a nice way to feel like I was in the mix, but also had privacy and great sleep. Very clean. Very friendly.  Exactly what I needed for a weekend spent wandering around. The location is perfect. And I didn__ find it noisy when it was time to get rest. Thanks_ I__l be back!"
"We booked jayanthi's place in last minute but she was so prompt in answering our call and we completed our booking. She is a very hospitable and approachable host prompt to answer our calls and making arrangements for the survival amenities we needed during our stay. The place is in a very safe locality close to mrts as well as Mustafa center and many restaurants. The Great thing about this place is the versatility. You can either choose cab or mrts, choose restaurant or cook yourself, you can stay home or go for shopping everything is so close you feel as if you're in home away from home. The place is well maintained sparkling clean. Maid and helps available at your request to make your beds. If I have to do knit picking I'll just request her to add a screen to the balcony side door. Everything else was as described and did it's purpose! Thanks for making our vacation stay great! Lots of love!"
"Everything is ok, accept the lift was stop working for a few hours and we have to climb up to our 4th floor room. Generally, worth for what you've paid"

A wonderful place to stay if you want to explore the heart of Singapore! Many nice advices and tips from the host and so so near the MRT which allows you to travel everywhere easily!
Quick and hassle free
The apartment was nice and cosy. It was comfortable and felt like home. The cable tv kept us occupied for hours. Aircon was cold and balcony is great for smokers. The apartment was very near to Farrer Park MRT Exit F and walking distance to Mustafa Centre as well as City Square Mall. Will definitely consider staying again in future. Thank you Bella!
Cool and simple!
Nice place
Great apartment with a very cozy ambience! Surroundings are pretty quiet and safe too.
"Place located at the heart of the city, surrounded by the most mouth watering food. Everything about the place is of satisfactory. Cheers."
"Would stay again, easy to check in and overall a good stay!"
"Very easy to check in and out, nice and cosy!"
Great stay! Thank you!
Must to be ..well organized ...cool awesome
Good quiet place to rest and relax.
A great apartment to stay in for a short period of time!
Bellas place was amazing. it was clean and very cosy. Communication was exceptional and she responded to queries and requests immediately. On the downside the place was on a lower floor which is just above a street of shops which gets pretty noisy in the morning. Also the shades wernt able to block out the sunlight entirely.
"Clean, value for money, cosy place to hangout. Expect bright afternoon sun & a lil noisy as below level & opposite are shop houses. Thank you Bella & Puji for being a great host."
A good small place for staycationing. The apartment has private lift that goes to the a very tiny lobby of the apartment and also where the kitchen is near the fire exit. Also the fire exit door had no lock or bolt of any kind which seemed a bit unsafe. But overall a good experience.
Highly recommended
A nice clean place
.
"Bella's place was a really great find for us. The apartment is a very bright and clean (A+:) apartment and gives great vibes. It is in a wonderful location, very close to   Little India, which is bustling with a terrific range of Indian restaurants and shops that sell anything you might need, with  the bonus that the apartment itself is in a  quiet and peaceful place. Bella  is a wonderful and pleasant host!  Highly recommend!"

Lucinda is lovely and helpful."
"Very comfortable and spacious room, clean and well kept"
Lucinda's apartment is in a very convenient location near to food places and shopping malls. Communication was smooth and the room was clean and nicely decorated with thoughtful touches.

"I loved location, very convenient to get to pretty much anywhere in the city and only a few steps away from the MRT station. The room itself is a little small, especially if you unfold the sofa bed, but it__ definitely workable. I noticed the bathroom floor looked a bit dirty, and there is a serious lack of convenient power outlets in the room, but overall, no major complaints."
"We had a wonderful stay at this hosting. The place was convenient for travelling especially for first timers and we felt at home. Thanks for your hospitality, Lucinda!"

The location is amazing - right next to Bugis station! Lucinda was lovely and always very quick responding to any questions I had. The room is quite big for Singapore and clean. Thank you for a great stay!
"Actually this was my first AirBnB booking i made, and choosing Lucinda__ space didn__ disappoint me. She__ a great host really. She communicates well with us though we just stayed for a night only.  Her place is centrally located, close to prime __ust see places _ of Singapore. Very accessible to any means of transport. Restos are just everywhere around her area."
"Lucinda is very friendly host, comunicative and thoughtful. The room is nice and clean."
Thank you for Hosting us. It was a Great Stay.
"Perfect position to visit Singapore (close to Bugis metro station) and very close to restaurants, pub, supermarket etc. Cozy room with bathroom, very clean. Lucinda has been super kind and helpfull. Thank you!"
"Location was great, 3-5mins  to Bugis Junction/Bugis MRT. Alot of food places nearby, 7-11 within walking distance. Hospitality was great, Lucinda was very thoughtful during the check-in process. Would definitely come here again !"
Great location to explore the city from! Good apartment and close to everything.

"Location, easy to access and very easy to check in. Spacious for 4 persons."
"We had the room with small en-suite, with king size bed which was really comfortable. Enjoyed using the massage chair. There was a quaint hostel feel to it with shared kitchen. Lucinda was very accommodating and gentle, and we were able to leave our bags there after a late checkout. Our two teenagers got the sofa bed, and a fold out bed which were ok for one night, although a bit of a squeeze with 4 in the room. Would stay again, great location."
The place is superb! Lucinda was very helpful and the location was great. Super clean super everything. Will definitely come back.
This place is near Bugis MRT and surrounded by places to eat. The room is very clean & the host add a lot of little touches that made our stay wonderful & comfortable.
"Lucinda__ place is in such a fantastic location. 
Her instructions for location were spot on especially with a tired family arriving late at night. 

We are a family of four and it was a squeeze however we only needed a place to sleep so it was perfect. 

It is a shared kitchen but again we were only there for two days so we had no intention of cooking! 

I would highly recommend this place and wouldn__ hesitate to come back in the future."
Very thoughtful tips
Really close to everything and good environment.
Great location. Communication with host was excellent. We were comfortable. Best mattress ever.
Great place.  Amazing location.  Very clean.  Will come back
Lucinda is an amazing host. Her hospitality is on the highest level. The communication with her is quick and flawless. She is very thoughtful - the bed for our little daughter was prepared by arrival so we could just lay her down. Everything was clean and nice. Next time we are visiting Singapore we for sure will stay with you again. Thank you for everything!!
"Lucinda is very communicative person and give the great hospitality. The location is near to many great spot in Singapore (Bugis Street, Bugis Junction, Suntec City, and culinary location).
Hoping to stay here again and again..."
"Lucinda was very considerate and kind during our stay especially when my husband broke the key at the main entrance. She also allowed us to check in early and let us leave our luggages after our check out so we could roam around freely before our flight.

What I liked the most about her place was, it was near the train station and a lot of food hawkers around. It is also clean, quiet and safe. Her nephew was also helpful.

I highly recommend this place.
Thank you, Lucinda. :)"
good location ....
"Value for your money, clean room with a bathroom in the best position in town, almost everything within walking distance, food, shopping, sightseeing.Lucinda always there for you!"
La ubicaciÃ³n es buena pero que sea compartido el alojamiento rompe los esquemas de las familias que viajan
"Stayed there for 4 days New Years 2019 with family of 4. Room wasn__ ideal for family as it was too small but mainly the sofa and foldable bed for the kids were hard to sleep on. However, the location is great and host was helpful. The room would be perfect for 2."

"Good location, no frills no tv, basic room and kitchen use. Alarm sound in lobby went off for 2 days before it was reset, a little unsettling for my young son whenever we use the elevator."
"Great location, close to MRT. The sofa bed is a bit hard to sleep on. Other wise is good value for money."
"Apartment is very good located, just near the metro station  BUGIS. The room is very clean, cousy and comfortable for living. Bed clothes and towels are good quality.

"100% recommend. Fantastic, central location. The best bed we've ever slept on. Perfect if you want a quiet place to come back and relax in. The common area is small and no AC, so more of a place that you'd want stay in your room. The room has great closet space and a couch to relax on though. Lovely host!"

Don__ get me started on the bed! One of the best beds i__e ever slept on!

"Ich habe so etwas noch nie erlebt. Hatte mich bei Aaron fÃ¼r eine andere Wohnung entschieden gehabt . Und als wir gerade zum Flughafen fahren wollten ...sind wir angerufen worden und mitgeteilt bekommen er kÃ¶nne uns die Wohnung nicht geben. Wir kÃ¶nnten stornieren oder diese Wohnung nehmen. Wir waren richtig gezwungen die Option zu ziehen. Die WG war viel kleiner und total Ã¼berteuert. Auch wenn er eine Differenz Zahlung geleistet hat. Meine Tochter musste in einem Zimmer schlafen was eine Abstellkammer gleich kam. Ein Bett und jeweils 10 cm Platz links und rechts...

Fazit: Meine erste schlechte Erfahrung..."
Lucy is definitely a helpful and friendly host! She always responded in a timely manner. I had a very comfortable experience. The location is so good for visitors.
Good
"Lucy was always available by phone and will accommodate to all your needs.  The room was as described and clean.  Lastly, the location to the MRT was very convenient."
"Quite clean, and convenient. It would be much better if we can have 2 keys for the room."
"Great location, Nice room condition nd nice hosting."
It__ really recommended place to stay. You__l feel like stay at your own house. The owner is so heartkinded woman I__e ever known. Be back as soon as possible. Xx
Lucinda__ place is very convenient if you would like to stay close to the centre of Singapore. We walked everywhere and the local amenities are closer such as local buses and train services. You will never run out of food choices here as you are close to local food restaurants with plenty of choices. However I wouldn__ recommend this place if you like your own privacy and amenities as you would need to share the main bathroom and main areas with other guests. I stayed there with my wife and we really loved the locality and the food they offered. Lucinda as a host was very kind and respectful and was really helpful with all requests and matters such as early check in and late check out.
"She(host) was incrediblt kind!
we didn't message her before check in and came to the room 3 in the morning but she took  pictures and explained to us through Airbnb messages
Thank you so much Linda!"
"Chambre bien situÃ©e, prÃ¨s des quartiers historiques chinois et arabe _ une distance de marche. Il faut juste noter que la salle de baim est partagÃ©e avec 3 autres chambres.

"definitely I will be back again! All facility in apartment is so convenient and location is the heart of town which you can walk around so easy! and restaurant also around apartment.

The place is very secure and located at the 6th floor. The place is clean and you have everything you needed. Lucinda responded to our query immediately and is always willing to help. I definitely recommend the place and will be back soon. â­__â­__â­__â­__â­__
"The place is clean and comfortable to stay. The location is great, there are so many restaurants and shopping arcades around the place. I have a great time to stay here. Lucinda is a great host, she took care of the place very well and fast communication. I will back to stay next trip for sure! Recommended!

Thank you _¤ï_"
"The place is definitely worth it. Located next to Bugis, you can reach the MRT within 3mins or even walk to a lot of places and a lot of restaurants near by. Even though the apartment is next to a big road, it is quiet up on the 6th floor. Communication was super easy and we could even leave our bags after check-out time."
I do believe you will love this place.
Very homely and comfortable. Great hospitality!
"It Is a great place, I will definitely come back again"

"Stayed one night, perfect location. Easy to find from the MRT station. Recommend for a short stay in Singapore if you don't care about sharing with host and don't need a lot of time in the room :) Would recommend!"
It was a great stay and Lucinda was really friendly and helpful. We could reach everything by foot (it was a long walk but still) and even let our luggage stay in her apartment after check out.
"Very kind host, Lucinda was very fast responding and accommodating. The space was clean, the beds were comfortable and we had a great stay. The location is perfect - walking distance from the Marina Bay area, the Bugis Market and many great restaurants and hawker centers. Will recommend to anyone!"
Lucinda was really patient even though we kept being delayed and didn't get to her place until very late on the evening. She has s lovely flat in a great location.
Super nice place for a short stay in Singapore! Lucinda replies to messages very quickly and enabled us to store our luggage after check-out.
Lucinda is a great host and made sure we had everything we needed. She even let us do a late check out which was great!
"Excellent location. Room was as advertised. This is shared with 4 other rooms, so has a hostel feel to it, and quality of beds were about the same level. Place was kept very clean and host was friendly. Would recommend for short stays where you simply need a bed."
While visiting during and attending the Formula 1 Grand Prix the location was perfect! The room was spacious and all round great hospitality
"Recommended place, strategic location, really close with bugis mrt, easy to access, many restaurant untill late night. The apartment is clean and I like the massage chair because really helpful for relaxing. Tq"
"A very cozy and clean room. The host is very helpful. although we arrived early in the morning, she  still helped us for self check in . The directions of the location is so detailed , so you can find the place easily. The location is convenient to most sight spots.  You need to share the bathroom with people in the other 3rooms, but it is acceptable."

Clean place to stay at a good location!
Very nice stay! There is one Bathroom for four bedrooms but simply to find and near to the next MRT-Station! Good for a cheap and comfortable stay in Singapore!
A great host and excellent services/facilities
"Good location and clean place. Very close to the train station. Host was clear and provided a smooth check-in experience. However, be aware that the place only has one bathroom for everyone to share and can get competitive."
Licinda is a wonderful host and she helps and accommodates you as per your requirements.
"It is just a few minutes walk from the nearest station.
The hosts were very friendly and kind, and communication before arriving was prompt.
Definitely recommend this Airbnb for everyone who wants a stay in Singapore."

Lucinda es muy agradable, siempre estaba disponible para responder a cualquier pregunta o necesidad que tuvieses, muy buena anfitriona!!! La ubicaciÃ³n del apartamento es excelente, el barrio es muy animado y con muchos lugares para comer o tomar una copa, el barrio Arabe estÃ¡ a 5 minutos caminando, y tienes el metro a 1 minuto del apartamento, estÃ¡s a dos paradas de todo lo que hay que visitar en Singapur. Recomiendo 100% el alojamiento de Lucinda y sin duda vamos a volver a quedarnos con ella."

"Excellent location. Very helpful host and a nice and quiet area, even if it's the city center. The beds were comfy and plenty of storage space in the room.
Great that we had water all the time for drinking. 
The shower is shared, it's not the cleanest and it can do with an upgrade. Especifically elements that aren't working as intended.
I really recommend this place if you can handle the shared bathroom."
"Lucinda is very nice and cares for the well being of her guests, she answers very fast to text messages if you need anything. The place is very clean, well equipped and it's a good location in Singapore. The wifi is a bit low in the twin bed, it is best to go in the living room to send pictures to your relatives or charge videos. A good experience :)"
Great place!
Awesome location. Beautifully clean and simple. Shared with 4 other rooms in the same apartment but plenty of space and  sound proofed well. Perfect for a busy holiday.

Lucinda is a very friendly and nice host. She is understanding and try to fulfill my requirements. Great hospitality from her.
Most helpful person you will come across ever...special attention of the property is massaging chair. Everything available on the property.
Clean is important
good choice

"We loved staying here, everything we needed for our two girls was here (cot,  high chair, swimming pool(s), children's play area and so many books/children's toys that we could use. The location was nice and quiet, perfect for families but close to everything central using Grab was never a problem. Highly recommended!!"
We had a wonderful stay here! This is an extremely comfortable condo in a very good location. Our hosts were very responsive. Amazing swimming pools and even a small playground so very kid friendly. We highly recommend!!!
"Great hospitality, prompt response and very helpful!"
"That's really super excellent condo for renting, it is realy clean and neat for whole apartment and the service is also very warmly and excellent.  
Strongly recommend~~~"
"Kates place is spacious. There is full use of the kitchen which was useful for us. The property has a nice pool. The property is situated on the East Coast and unfortunately there is no direct public transport to Orchard. It's a 10minute walk to the nearest MRT which is located by a shopping mall which has a lot of mainly asian cuisine eateries and also has a Fair Price supermarket. There is an awesome Onsen and massage place called Yunimori which is phenomenal.  There is a bus right outside the front of the compound which is handy however it only takes you to the MRT or other suburban locations and not Orchard. Kate was very prompt to reply and gave us a great intro to Singapore. Overall, our stay was good and I would recommend her place."
The place is very close to the main areas and easily accessible. Very large and comfortable home.
"Kate and Gil were absolutely fantastic! They are very responsive hosts, extremely accommodative and very positive! We wanted to play tennis and they immediately responded and helped us book courts, despite our last minute request. Their helper Jane is also extremely friendly and helpful. We felt very welcomed and at ease! The amenities are superb, and there is a bus stop directly outside the apartment. We would come back here if we ever chose to visit Singapore again! THANK YOU!"

"This 230m2  condo cost ~3M usd. 
With this price, you cannot find anything better in the city.
really enjoy the pool, the gym and the sauna room.
The convenience store in the lobby accept Alipay and (Hidden by Airbnb) pay."
"Absolutely stunning condo.  Kate & Gil were wonderfully responsive hosts.  The location was great & got us away from the main tourist strip & we got to see how the locals live.  With only a short walk to a great mall we had fun at the ping pong & pool bar & lots of great food options plus the biggest supermarket we have ever been in - wow!  The MRT (subway) is just at the mall too and we used this every day - safe, cheap & easy way to get around to all that Singapore has to offer - which is a lot!  The grounds & pools at the Condo are amazing - this was the best pool we have ever swam in & we spent a few lazy days enjoying the pool, daybeds & bubbling spa.  Highly recommend."
"Super location, close to public transportation & supermarket, great pool, excellent host."
"Kate's condominium is in a great quiet location, and the space makes you feel right at home in Singapore."
"Kate and Gil were super responsive and hospitable. We loved the spaciousness of the condo and the amenities nearby. Although tidy, the condo could definitley use a deep clean and reorganization (particularly the kitchen and laundry area). Overall, it was a good experience."
"It__ a nice and functional condo. Kitchen is equipped for simple meals for a small family. The grounds are nice and the store in the lobby is very handy but cash only. Internet is fast, which is a good thing since there is no TV. The condo could use a bit more attention to cleaning. 
It is worth noting that the __ingle_ bed is actually a toddler bed. It will not accommodate a larger child or adult."
"Very spacious, beautiful apartment next to the river. The place is perfect with little kids and very well equipped.
Kate always replies very fast. Can absolutely recommend the place."
Staying with Tricia's family was an absolute pleasure. I felt very comfortable and at home. The apartment was very clean and everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. I would definitely like to stay with them again in the future and I would recommend this air bnb to anyone!
The room is exactly the same as in pics.  clean and stylish.  convenient transportation system.  Brian is really cool~ Enjoyed my time there.
I really recommend the place as the host are very hopitable. I really like how they initiate conversatiins on what can be done in Singapore and their life as a local. I wouldn't mind getting this place again the next time I plan to visit Singapore. two thumb up.
"really nice people who help, the room was big. i was a few days sick and could recover very well!"
Very clean room. Fuss free check in and check out. Near to food. A bit far from the mrt station but there is a bus stop below the block.
"I am very enjoying to stay in Tricia house.  Because the house is so cozy,  comfortable,  clean and perfect,  i was prefer to stay there in weekend rather than going anywhere.  Tricia and Lok also a great host that have polite communication and very welcoming person.  I definetely will go there again once i visit singapore again."
"A cosy room in a 3 room apartment. You get to have access to all areas of the apartment such as TV room, kitchen, etc. The check in and check out was easy and hassle free. The host provided all necessary instructions clearly.

A very affordable room although far from main tourist areas of Singapore. Being 10 mins walk away from MRT station so getting around is easy. But expect to change 2 or more trains and train ride may take 45 to 55 minutes depending where your are going.

Overall my stay was comfortable and pleasant. Had no issues whatsoever and if ever I will visit Singapore, I would certainly book Tricia's place again."
"Clean and confortable, you can use the kitchen and the common spaces. Near the MRT station, but a bit far from the downtown (50min approx by train). The neighborhood is very peaceful."
Highly recommended. Host is very understanding and always responds quickly.
"really nice place, the location is not too far from the mrt station. recommend to the people who wash to stay at north and west part of Singapore"
Would reccomend this place for travellers looking to stay in singapore for a long time as hosts are really friendly. Although the location is a bit far from the city
"very good host, bit of difficult for transport, MRT in 10mins walk..a lot food at MRT point"
"Very clean flat, but rather far away from the main drag.  Need to take feeder bus after changing MRT lines.  Due to the long commute, I decided to  stay elsewhere after 3 nights and returning the last day to use the internet service.  It is a good place to stay if you don't mind the long commute."
"It might be a bit out of town and you need a while to get into the City. 
But there is a lot of interesting nature as well as forests around. 
If you enjoy that, and find them you'll have a lot of great hours to walk."
"Although it's far from city centre, it's a good place to stay, if u don't mind the long commute"
"Private Room with good surrounding, amenities and privacy for short term. In addition, it is also a good place just for a weekend stay!"
Great for the price
Slightly far from town but a comfortable stay.

"Great location, great room size, great cleanliness, and most importantly great host. Definitely a 10 out of 10! Thanks Lucinda for the amazing hospitality!"
"It was very cozy place. She is very helpful, kind, and polite. The location is very close to Bugis station. Also, if you have any business at Suntec, it is the place to stay."
Small cozy place to stay with small pax people
"Lucy quiet little apartment is probably one of the best locations in Singapore, right near Bugis Street and pretty much 10-20 min walking distance from a lot many attractions. Its a family style apartment where each of the 5 rooms have been converted to individual spaces and listed separately. All the guests who would be present would share the kitchen and laundry, I didn't care as I didn't need it. We also shared the same bathroom (usually no wait as I think in this trip, only 2-3 other rooms were booked). The room is just right size for one person and as shown in pictures. The mattress is fine, the only little thing is that the AC is above door and facing towards window while the bed is recessed on inside, so it would take about 1-2 hours to actually cool the room. I think the AC could use a check its possible its not working to its optimum. The one great amenity here was full body massaging chair, which would work great and was quite a treat for the sore back and legs. Communication was top notch, and I would definitely recommend this to a budget traveller vs booking hotels in this area."
Great place in a great area close to everything. Lucinda is a fantastic host and made sure that my check in and out was speedy and easy. Also so helpful and welcoming so this is a perfect spot for anyone looking for a place in Singapore.
You get what you pay for. Value for money. Excellent location
"Place was good, toilets are clean, room is as advertised"
Nice and clean apartment with a good location. The self checkin system was easy and useful+.
"We stayed at Lucinda__ place for 3 nights. It was a very comfortable stay with amazing value. The bed was comfy and we loved that body wash, shampoo, and conditioner were provided. The location is great if you want to be close to Bugis. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a private room."
"Lucinda ist sehr nett, wenn man Fragen oder WÃ¼nsche hat versucht sie es zu ermÃ¶glichen. Wir konnten sogar frÃ¼her Einchecken. Es gibt in der KÃ¼che eine Waschmaschine und einen Trockner, die man benutzen darf. Ebenfalls Tee und Kaffee.  Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefÃ¼hlt. Nur das anstehen beim Badezimmer war 2x etwas lange und laute GerÃ¤usche im Hinterhof von den AbzÃ¼gen der Restaurants. Die Betten sind auch sehr bequem und es war ausreichend Platz. Im Flur steht ein Massagesessel, der super massiert ! Sehr gerne wieder."
"Lovely accommodation. Clean, comfortable. Lovely host. Allowed me to drop my bags off early. I would definitely recommend."
"Lucinda is definitely a great host, even when we had issues with the booking, she actively helped and coordinated what was needed. Her place was great! Location was very convenient, very close to the train and you can walk across the tourist spots. Amenities were also complete, even offering free coffee and tea and use of the kitchen. We'll definitely recommend this place. :)"
Lucinda was so great with communication! This place had wonderful touches (such as a massage chair) that really topped off the stay. Location is also PRIME for any tourists wanting to explore the city.
"Lucinda__ place is very nice. We have booked just one day before and the communication between us was smooth and quick, we arrange a self check in super easy and we enjoyed the 1 night there. The room is clean and has some gifts for you :) 
The location is good and near to the metro station, you can go anywhere from there. 
There are also other room with hosts there so it__ really suggested if this point don__ bother you. 
Many thanks for the nice stay!"
"The location is wonderful. Room is nice. There are washing machine, dryer, microwave and even massage chair. Lucinda even provides hair conditioner and body lotion. It__ a great place to stay if you visit Singapore."
Lucinda was very kind and responsive to all my tourist and first timer experience questions! At first I didn__ realize I would be sharing a living space with other people but it was nice since I got to meet people. Only difficult part is having to share a bathroom haha but it still so worth the location and price.
"The airbnb is perfectly located, very clean and the bed was comfortable.
Lucinda let me check in quite early in the morning - this was absolutely great and I didn__ expect this. Also there are some details which are just great, like Water, coffee, conditioner and shampoo etc 
Thanks for the great stay!! Definitely recommend it."
Good room!! Excelent Guesthouse
"my stay in Singapore was great thanks to Lucinda, the location is great, thank you Lucinda! my 5 stars rating!"
Lucinda__ place is very central and close to restaurants and the sights of Singapore. We had a great stay.
Great location. Great massage chair too ;)
I highly recommend this place! Lucinda is an outstanding host. The location is perfect.
"Lucinda was a great host, friendly, supportive and always responded super fast. The room was very clean and has everything you need. Plus the location of the Airbnb was fantastic, you can easily reach the marina bay by foot. Would definitely come again!"
The 101 Airbnb was kept clean daily by Lucinda. It was so central for MRT interchange / connections to many places of interest. A short walk to Raffles Hotel and CHIJMES where my former school was. The only setback was one toilet/ shower shared amongst four rooms. However we had a good pleasant stay for seventeen days.
"Everything was perfect! The place is very well located!! You can not ask for more with this price. She's a lovely host and we can use everything.
Thank you!"
"Clean place to stay. Private room with its own lock and key, but you will share one bathroom with multiple rooms. The WiFi can be kind of slow. But overall a clean place to stay in a good location around lots of restaurants."

A very noche place Edith excellent ubication and really confortable!
"Apartment is perfect for solo travelers! Great space and comfortable bed. Big plus was having a kitchen and washer as well. Location is very central to everything. Lots of food options just down the street, as well as Bugis Junction mall. Several other things within 10 minutes walk as well. Being near the Bugis MRT was also helpful in being able to reach other parts of Singapore, including downtown and the airport. Lucinda was a wonderful host and was easy to reach and communicate with. Wonderful stay!"
"Great location, do recommend. Taxi from the airport will cost about 20 Sing dollars. MRT Bugis station just a few minutes walk away. Bus stop on the doorstep. Bugis and Suntec shopping malls either side of the apartment. Can walk up the road to Haji lane and Sultan mosque in about 10 minutes. 20 minute bus ride to HarbourFront where you can walk to Sentosa from, for Universal studios. Everything asked from Lucinda was given to us. We could also wash our clothes there. There__ a S hared bathroom with 3 other rooms, which can be very busy in the morning, bathroom is a little hot like a sauna. Aircon in the room is good and you can also lock your own bedroom door for safety. No need to buy food and cook in the kitchen as there is cheaper and better food outside in every direction. Some loud construction sound in the daytime from across the street which shouldn__ disturb you much if you__e busy outside being a tourist. Stayed here 6 nights. Use EZ card for your transportation it__ much better than the tourist passes. National Museum of Singapore, Gardens by the Bay and Satay street near Raffles square were the highlights, enjoy."
"Lucinda__ place was perfect for my 2 nights in Singapore! She included everything I would need include power adapters, water in the room, and other nice touches. The location is in walking distance to lots of nearby locations and attractions. Would definitely recommend!"
"Great location (apart from building works all around), short walks to Downtown, Little Arabia, Little India and MRT Bugis. Apartment is pretty standard especially compared to the fancy photo's, but facilities are good: it even includes a massage chair! Shared bathroom with multiple rooms is a bit of a hassle. Recommended!"
Lucinda is really a terrific host and we love the fact that her flat is located very near to must-see places in SG.
I__ really recommend this place. This place is very comfortable for travel by bus or mrt. If I come back to Singapore I__l stay here again for sure!

Clean and near to bugis junction mall
Very close to everything and close to bus and train. Very clean and host very helpful response. Best advise.
"Lucinda war sehr gut zu erreichen und hat immer sehr schnell geantwortet.
Das Zimmer war fÃ¼r 2 Personen ausreichend.
Duschen sollte man nicht zu den Sto_zeiten, da man sich das Bad mit 4 weiteren Zimmern teilt.
Leider haben wir nachts Ã¼berhaupt nicht geschlafen, weil es so laut war.
Auch Oropax haben leider nicht geholfen. Vor der TÃ¼r ist eine Baustelle, bei der auch nachts durchgehend gearbeitet wird. Daher leider nicht erholsam.
Die Lage ist aber gut und man hat viele MÃ¶glichkeiten Essen zu gehen und hat gute Anbindungen fÃ¼r die Bahn."
"A little bit of a learning curve readjusting to a shared toilet and shower, but it__ a small price to pay for a fantastic host, location, and great level cleanliness. Very good value."
"Lucinda's place was so amazing,very clean,near mrt station,and also there's bunch of restaurant arround"
_¹å____é©
"The space is in a great location with some good places to eat and bugis station around the corner, and communication with Lucinda made it easy to get checked in on time. It's a small room, but if you're there to be out exploring the city, it's a cozy spot to come home to."

"Adrian was a great host, our stay was amazing thank you!!"
Our group had a great stay. The convenience and proximity to the touristy locations and the tranquience in the complex was a perfect combination. Hopefully we can stay here again on our next trip to SG :)

Great location and clean. Everything worked like a hostel should with privacy and great bathroom.
On a street with picturesque colonial buildings surrounded by modern skyscrapers Tras 49 is located in the heart of Singapore whilst giving you a feel of being in a cozy little town. Ideal for both business travelers and tourists alike. Highly recommended
Fabulous location!
"Neha__ place is great value for money in Singapore. It__ in a well-equipped serviced apartment building with full amenities.

Near Chinatown - lots of great food options.

Neha herself is a very good communicative host.

Definitely recommended"
Neha__ services apartment was really clean and the staff was friendly and the rooms were comfortable. There is a food court nearby and you can really enjoy the local feel of Singapore. It was really nice to have the entire family together as we couldn__ do this at a hotel.
"Neha's apartment was perfect for our stay in Singapore. 24hour reception desk, breakfast, pool and daily servicing meant we had all the advantages of a hotel, combined with the a sitting area we could spend time as a family. The space was well planned and spotless, and the staff were all friendly and helpful. We used taxis (grab) to get around which was very quick and easy from the apartment. Approx $SD8 to Marina Bay Gardens for example. Thank you Neha"
The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
The location is very clean and the host was very easy to communicate with. We enjoyed the stay and the indian food nearby ;-)

"Honestly, this listing is not worth the listed price and I would not recommend it to others. The photos make the place look deceiving. It is very very small to the point where no one was comfortable. We stayed there for 6 nights and were only given one toilet roll. The host was standard, but it was just not worth our money to stay there"

"Very tidy and lovely AirBnb apartment equipped with everything you need. A good bed and nice bathroom. The guy is a great host and there when you need him, Very nice and wants to share all hÃ© know about the area. We had a great stay!"
"The location is quite good, but you have to wait for the host to come outside because the owner didnt give the passcode number for the front door to check in, so you have to wait outside if the host doesnt respond"
"Good location
Good service"
Responsive host and easily contactable
Good place to stay overall. For the price point you can't beat this area. Very accessible to public transport and can walk to places as well
"Ong's place was super clean and in a great location! Having the bus stop right in front was really convenient. It was a bit smaller than I expected, but is still perfect for two. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to visit Singapore!"
"_¹å_å¥,è·__è±¡ä¸­____"
Good place to stay.  Enjoyed it.
Great place
"Good place to stay, but the bed's linens and the sofa were dirty(especially sofa).
I enjoyed with Netflix on big screen TV.
First night I couldn't sleep till morning because a group of people screaming under my window. And in a day there were repair sounds under my window, then a drill, then a saw. Sleeping to these sounds was terrible."
Great place! Clean environment
Amazing place!
Overall a good place
Good and spacious room! Love the design and vibe of this place

"The place is clean and cute. It's a great place for only 1-2 people staying. When there're 3 or above, the sofa would be turned into a queen-sized bed, making the room pretty small."
A unique clean nice apartment !
_¿å_å¾_¥½ä½
All is good
"Great place to live, quite place, but little far from Mrt station but the bus station is right front of the appartment."
Really nice place to stay for a few nights... We'll be back! Thanks for everything

"The place is near orchard rd and other city attractions, using bus was very easy too.  We sleep and rest well in the night since the place is much quite. I could make breakfast for my kid, do the laundry. The host and staff are very helpful too. We had a great time. Thank you."
"The stay was nearly as expected.
Room was very Clean, Check-in and Checkout was very easy
 
Only Thing that was not as expected was that the room was smaller than looking on the Pictures

For three people it was a little small. 

But everything Else was completely fine"
"Good Place, good value. Bathroom, kitchen and washer all in good condition and well equiped. We're a group of 4 and the room size was enough for us . Most of all : the bus stop is very close! (Right outside the apartment) . Definetely will come back :)"
Location near Clarke Quay and very clean.
"The room is in moderate size. Not too small but not big either, which is normal in singapore. The bus stop is right in front of the house, so it is pretty convinient . The shower is very nice, with the water is pretty hot. A good place to stay , and there is a supermarket not far from the location, in case we need some daily stuffs."
"RC__ place is a great place to stay.. RC is a great host.. u will get a quick response if u need anything. the place is clean and not too far to orchard area.. if u would like  to take a bus, the bus stop just right in front of the place. happy to stay at rc__ place."
situated in nice residential area. 10-15 mins walk to orchard road. just in front of bus stop. 10-15 mins walk to nearest mrt st (somerset or fort canning). Would be better if there is any local tips.
"This studio apartment was a great base for our stay in Singapore. The bus stop is conveniently right on the doorstep, and the MRT is about a 10 minute walk. Marina Bay and many of the other downtown attractions are only a short taxi ride away. Rc made checking in and out very easy, and was happy to accommodate our late check-in. He was also was very quick to respond to any queries we had. The studio was a little small for the three of us, but a good use of space meant that it had all the amenities we needed. It would be perfect for two people."
Really clean and comfortable. Great if you__e looking for a short stay in the city - it__ quite compact. Good internet connection and awesome touch having Netflix available.
It fits for a family of 3.
Overall is good and cozy. Convenience place to find.
Very good would totally come back again
"Having a short staycay as a newly wedd couple. Comfortable, location wise is good. Nearby to town area. Overall is a good place to spent."
Loved the location. Walkable distance to orchard central (nice stroll back after dinner). Coffeeshop and 24hrs ntuc within a 5mins walking distance. Bus to town area / bugis takes less than 20mins.
Looks more spacious in picture but still a value for money stay. Remember to bring your own toiletries and tissue paper (we had to use the toilet roll)
A great place to stay at!!
Small but comfortable spot close to Somerset MRT (10 minute walk)

"The power went out in the entire condo on the 2nd of 4 nights do to a problem outside the unit.  Aaron__ rep sent an electrician at 11:30 pm to try to fix... but problem was not in unit.

Because of no air conditioning in very hot Singapore , we needed to move to hotel but Aaron generously refunded 100% of money with full apologies even though it was not his fault."
Nice place
"Do not book this property or any of the properties with this Host. Firstly he would only respond in one word. Secondly he may just cancel your reservation at the last minute, and say sorry and get away with it. Air BNB will also refund your money as is in no time however there are NO compensation for the customer even though they would levy penalties on the Host or atleast they claim to do so. If you log a complaint they would call but only at their convenience. So they tried to call me at the time when i was travelling overseas for this trip and had limited reach. Once i was back from the trip they have not attempted to call me. I am pretty sure this will not be published. But then i will take things to Social Media."

Great location with many food shops surrounding.
Apartment was the same as picture . But overall the bed is comfort and house is nice . N everything is there for use . N kelvin was a great hospitality to help us as much as he can Well done kelvin .
"El departamento estÃ¡ descuidado, sucio y con plaga en el baÃ±o."
"Very kind and helpful staff and host. However, we experienced power outage issues and there was a live cockroach in the common area"
Nice and clean~
Wonderful n beautiful spacious room w comfy bed n scenery facing the swimming pool. There is. Swing outside the condo where u can sit n relax for long n i enjoyed the view bed n towels. It was heaven there
"Small, clean, comfortable room. Shared bathroom, also clean. Quiet suburban area. Lovely cat."
"Had a great, fuss-free stay & enjoyed the hospitality of the host & the cat :) The place is a nice 10mjn stroll from Serangoon MRT and easy access to a large swimming. As a supergost myself, I highly recommend staying here!"
"presents upon arrival; additional towels after knowing we are going out to swim; insider__ guide on good food that locals know; thoughtful cereal bars, Milo, and strawberry for us to kill morning hunger; laptop with Netflix and charging cables; complete toilet amenities...Grace has impressed us in many ways. The place is tranquil and cozy. First-class Singaporean lifestyle."
"Grace was amazing host. She is very friendly, helpful and kind. Place was nice and clean."
It really was a no brainer with check in/out - a very accommodating feature indeed. Overall a great time spending at Grace__. She was very responsive to my last-minute request and very hospitable even when I was only staying for a night. Thank you Grace!
"Grace, exceptional"
Grace's place is really nice! She is also kind and helpful as a host.
"My cousins stay there comfortably for one day, Grace shows great hospitality, would definitely recommend it."
"Grace is an amazing host with all the nice gestures and details she provided us!  The place was super clean and lovely,  I definitely recommend her place. She let us checked in slightly earlier and also let us leave our bags after we checked out because we had to catch the bus at midnight. 
One thing that might be noted: there is a cat in the place.  I didn't know before coming (not sure if I missed the information in the place details),  but I had no problem because the cat is really cute and shy. 
Overall I really enjoyed staying in her place and would definitely come back if I visit SG again!"
"The stay was wonderful, easy to get around, check in was straight forward, the home was really clean & tidy, hospitality was outstanding & the neighborhood is really quiet, safe and a few cafe around."
"Highly recommended stay. A very nice swimming pool right outside the door of the house that can be used by guests. The room/apartment was very clean and everything worked very smoothly. Our host, Grace, had arranged thoughtful details such as outlet adapter, phone charging cable and drinking water that we appreciated. The description resort style living was an accurate description."
Good place to stay in. Grace was a great host.
"very convenient place, highly recommend."
"Grace is a great host! 
Very kind and can see all her thoughtful touches around the apartment :)"
"Grace is very generous and kind she offered us free snacks when we arrived also she let us borrow her own kitchenware. Her place was very clean and cozy, exactly as she described. great for staycation. Will definitely go back to her place."
"We had an absolute amazing stay at grace apartment. The check in was so easy and the room was cozy, with everything you needed, a very comfy bed and even a little terrace in front. Everything was super clean and she provided the most amazing breakfast. She even offered us the chance to wash our clothes. The best thing of all was all the extras included like gym, pool or the sauna. We had a swim every morning and it felt like a true holiday. We would always come back. Grace was very kind and helpful, but also gave us privacy. We can highly recommend this place."
A Very good time at grace place +
"Nice place! Very accurate description - resort like, it has a relaxing view from the room from there you can see the pool. The room is clean and has a huge bed. Ms. Grace is very hospitable with the additional thoughtful touches such as the snack bars as we arrived, the chord and adapter socket that  was available inside the room and the free breakfast on the table the next morning. The cat is also adorable. Overall experience = EXCELLENT!."
"Good location, clean room and great host"
"Everything was perfect. The location is 10min walk from the metro, room with private bathroom with hair dryer, facial lotion, toothpaste etc., soft sheets and that smell good. Large swimming pool very nice, with sun lounger.
Our flight is late at night and we were able to leave our luggage at her house.
Thank you Grace"
"Grace's place is a very great place to stay.  Would be better if you travel light because the room was a little bit small. Despite small, everything in the room was great! It was so clean. Grace even provides snacks and water for us in the room. The bed was so comfy. The room is directly linked to the porch which is very relaxing. There is pool as well. Grace is very flexible as well."
"Highly recommended! Grace's unit is so stylish and sparkingly clean. I like how the room was painted in teal tone, it's so relaxing and calming. Plus the soft yellow lighting aesthetically illuminates the room which made it more chic. Grace was also very thoughtful - from being easy to talk to about the arrangements and tips on where to go, to preparing the room and providing snacks, drinking water and even breakfast as well as toiletries (hair dryer included!), and to being very generous (thanks for yummy cake!). Plus you get to play with the fluffy pet cat! Location is nice and serene. It is very accessible, just 10 minutes away from central areas like Clarke Quay via MRT. You can also take the bus just across the street."
"We spent the weekend at Grace's lovely place. She was a very kind and friendly host. Check-in was very easy and smooth, and we were greeted by the sweet cat who was quite shy but so nice to be around. The room is quite small but enough if you don't bring a giant suitcase. Grace kindly provided us with delicious snacks and breakfast throughout our stay and there were all kinds of toiletries we could have conveniently used. The comfortable bed, morning swims in the pool and hot tubs made us wish we could just stay a little longer and spend a proper vacation there. MRT station was quite close, approx. a 5-10 minute walk. We felt connected to the city yet secure and welcome. We would definitely come back one day. Thank you for this pleasant experience, Grace!"
"We would definitely stay at Grace__ again! It was the perfect room for our short stay in Singapore. She is a wonderful host and everything worked out smoothly.
Also the pool was great to refresh after a long day in hot Singapore!"
"Grace__ place is very stylish and super clean. Room was very comfortable and even had international chargers inside. Also I could enjoy delicious breakfast every day.
Grace Wes really nice and responded very fast to all my questions. Also her cat is super adorable!
Place is located very conveniently to get around the city. Highly recommend it!"
"Value - Location - Amenities - Host are super great!

A perfect place for your short stay in Singapore.  The place is within 10 mins walking away from Serangoon MRT station and a huge shopping mall NEX. Food is around the place and the hyper market is 24hrs at NEX, so your stomach never gets empty!
The room is great for 2 adults only. The host facilitates the best amenities for the guests. 
Grace is a nice and super host. With her thoughtfulness and hospitality, my friend and I had a wonderful trip in Singapore.
Highly recommended for those solo travelers, couples or group with 2 people only."
Very clean apartment. The owners have a really cool cat. the stay has been great and after our stay Grace left me a hand written note and some cookies as a gift ! What a lovely touch _ºï_
Thanks Grace for the hospitality service provided. Great location walking distance to MRT. Enjoyed and love the simple cereals breakfast provided by her. A very nice and caring host .
Great place to stay and explore Singapore! Great pool
"Great amenities and hospitality, would come back to stay again, and to pet the cat_ºï_"
Lovely host very kind and caring.
Comfortable room with kindly host
My friend and I had a very pleasant stay at Grace's flat!  The room is extremely clean and the bed is comfortable as well. The cat there is also very cute!  Grace was very considerate and provided us small gifts when we left:)  Will definitely recommend to anyone who wants a comfortable stay!
"Best host , Grace and her husband are the best host with delicate little touches to the rooms, free yummy breakfast and snacks.SHE__ THE BEST!
The area is awesome with nice food vendors, the house is indeed resort a-like.
Highly reccomend"
"Grace is very kind! She is very communicative and will help you with what you need. Her place is very clean, simple, and comfortable"
"Best Airbnb  experience ever,  amazing hospitality, much more than expectations. Surely would love to visit again. The  cute cat was an added attraction... Very accessible location, with proximity to MRT, bus stations and connectivity to airport (bus no. 24)."
"We had a great stay at Grace__ place. It is a very nice and talkative couple. The house is great, we loved the pool and the bed is amazing with exceptionally comfy matras. Would definitely come back."
Grace is friendly.  She has offered us fruits and snacks during our stay. Although the room is small but it is comfortable :)
Good
"Grace is a great host, very helpful, easy to contact and the apartment is really nice. Totally recommend."
"An extremely enjoyable experience. Everything was just as described and the host was more than hospitable. We felt safe in a secure location, and with a small walk all public transportation is close by which allowed us to fully enjoy our trip in Singapore. A delight, I would highly recommend Grace and will be sure to book again on future visits."
The swimming pool alone is reason enough to stay but grace is an excellent host. The location is a little out of the centre but it is easy to get everywhere by taxi. Would definitely return
Thanks for a great stay! Really enjoyed the pool!
Grace is a very good host. Place is clean and she provided helpful amenities. Amazing pool. Room is small but comfortable. I enjoyed my stay.
"Not much more to be said than has been said before. Grace is an incredible AirBnB host, the apartment is in a nice quiet area, access to public transit is easy, the cat is cute. Would definitely stay again!"

Thankyou to Grace for such a wonderful stay in Singapore! Such a beautiful and clean apartment in the perfect location! A bonus that it has a nice big swimming pool right on the door step! Grace was super helpful and very quick to reply. Would definitely stay here again! Thankyou for all your genuine help :)

The place itself is very safe in a beautiful living complex. We can definitely recommend it and would stay there again!"
"Clean bedroom with good air on to give you a good night rest while exploring Singapore! Self check in is very convenient. As we stayed out most of the day, we didn__ have the chance to meet Grace, but responses via AirBnB were very quick. Apartment is a 10-minute walk from Serangoon MRT, a bit outside of the city center, but very good connection through the MRT system."
"Grace was super helpful! All was good, and apartment in quiet area, close to MRT. You really feel like at home.Thank you so much"

Grace__ apartment was amazing! We stayed two days in her place. The location was good and the environment is so cozy. The room was so clean and tidy. We have our own toilet next to our bedroom. Grace and her husband was so friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend her place to my friends and family.
Indeed a superhost! Very helpful and accommodating. Grace even done extra favour for us. Nice place to stay.
"Small but nice Room with Pool and own Bathroom. Very nice Host! Good located close to the Trainstation, nice Restaurants and big Shopping-Mal."
Nice location and quick replies.
The capsule room we occupied was worth it. The hosts and hostess were friendly and very accommodating. Our family had a very memorable stay there. I guess what I liked most is that I got to meet other lodgers from different countries.

"Facilidad para realizar check in/out. Respuestas rapidas. 
La cercania a los quays y a varias estaciones de metro permite moverse rapido por la ciudad."
Good location. Not convenience if you've got a heavyweight hand carry.
"Be prepared that the room is quite small, although all the amenities needed for cooking and showering are there which is good. It is MANY stairs up and the lift does not go all the way to the top for this particular flat/apartment. It's a little bit of a maze getting in and out! Other than that it's not a long walk to Orchard Rd (10 mins) and near to some great eateries."
Nice location!
"Pat's place is perfect in terms of location-walking distance to Clarke Quay and Fort Canning underground station (Downtown Line). You can take underground train to her place from airport in 40-50 mins. But if you have big luggage better take taxi, it costs around 25 Singapore dollars and takes around 30mins.

There are a couple of sets of starirs to climb to the room but the satff is more than happy to help you to carry in and out.

The bedroom is relatively small compare with standard hotel room but undertandable in such a central location. Pat kindly added a single mattress for us as we are family of three. 

As the livingroom is huge you can also read in the livingroom, but most days we just go straight to bed after shower as sightseeing can be very tiring.

The shower is really good, very powerful, good size bathroom.

Pat had been very prompt in communication.

I would stay there again if visit Singapore again."
"Lovely quiet location which is easy access to Somerset and Fort Canning MRT stations. If it's hot or raining the walk is about 10 - 12 minutes without shelter though. There are bus stops right outside the property which get you into most places in the centre as well. The rooms are small but have everything you need. Comfortable stay and good amenities. It's an old colonial house that has been renovated on the inside so there's a few twists and turns taking your luggage up. Easy walk to some excellent street food, a 7-11 close by and Netflix if it's pouring outside."
For 3 people a little bit small but beside the space everything was nice and clean.
"Not a huge space but was enough for myself. Very clean place, enjoyed my stay!"
"Privacy, amenities, comfortable bed, nice linen, strong shower, actual windows, perfect location, even an outdoor patio for lounging. I could live here"
Great
Lovely accommodation and super central!
"[+] River Valley is great area, great   hygiene, nice bathroom, perfect for 2 peoples.
[-] complicated stairs even after going up the elevator."
The room was very clean and comfortable.  The place is little bit far from the station but it__ located near the central area. I could spend very good time in Singapore. Thank you.
Die Lage der Wohnung ist optimal im Zentrum. Die Bushaltestelle befindet sich direkt vor der TÃ¼r und in wenigen Minuten ist man an der Orchad Road. Die Wohnung ist allerdings Ã¤u_erst beengt und es fehlt ein kleiner Tisch zum Essen. Das ein und auschecken klappte optimal. Uns hat es dort gefallen.
"Wasnt near a train station but that__ okay, taxi was very cheap"
Sparkling clean
Strategic place to stay  in singapore. Nice n clean.
Worth the  Had a peaceful amd comfortable stay.
We liked this small comfortable room and the central public transport options by bus and MRT. It was a very good place for our time in Singapore.
Close proximity to major shopping areas and Chinatown.

It takes 10-15 min walk to the closest MRT station but there is a busy station right outside of the the building.
"Everything is perfect. 
Nice place, in center area. It is very close, only a step to the bus stop. But it took 10 mins to MRT. 
Strategic place to find food and good venue. We got free flow water, very perfect for us - tourists . 
Worth the money "
"I loved how the staff responds quickly to our queries. The place was clean. Walking distance to the MRT station, hawker centers, & convenience stores."
"Just as the pics show. 
MRT and buses nearby. Price/quality perfect.

Very noisy, even at night or at 5-6a.m. because the smoking area is behind the room or people in their rooms or in the hallway are talking. There is a gap between the door that makes noise."
"It's a tidy place of functional utility situated in a good location, just beside a bus stop. I will recommend for short stays."
Nice place
"J__ place is new, stylish and offers a lot of space for groups. Comfortable bed and new sheets that you wont have a hard time dozing off. Very much recommended!"
"Mr. J's place is very conveniently located and it's just a short cab ride to MBFC. My colleagues and I stayed for our business trip in Singapore. The place is spacious and easily shared among colleagues. The apartment is new, clean and nicely decorated. It has everything you need. Mr J even prepared a few international power converter for us."
Good apartment for group stay. Clean and Cozy.
"Thank you Mr. J for the great hospitality.

"Great space for a large group. Comfortable beds, clean house, heavy duty washing machine. More rugs in toilet would have better addressed the tendency of having wet floors after bathing. So many food establishments near address. No one will get hungry! Best location when you're in Singapore for a concent at the National Stadium. Host is super accommodating and quick to address queries."
The apt is as seen on Airbnb listing.  Nothing more.  We did only get one bath towel per person and no other towels.  No extra amenities but that may be Singapore way. We used grab app to get everywhere and train station - which was close.  Safe area.  We were there 2 nights so is was fine.  Check In was very easy.
"Fantastic three bedroom apartment close to most things, walking distance from MRT.
Looks exactly as photo show
J was great and  communicated well."
"Pretty clean and roomy, but not the most convenient of locations if you prefer to travel by public transport.  Location is also slightly sketchy, which is not unexpected given that Geylang is a red light district - perfectly fine if you book with this in mind."

The apartment is a bit out of the way if one wants to be close to the touristic attractions of Singapore, but they are still easily accessible. For family travelers this is a very good option, we enjoyed staying there.  Thank you, K."
Super clean. Awesome place and near food stall. Easy to find. The best place to stay. 5-star place

Super convienent and good food too, highly recommend the Leong Kee (Klang) Bak Kut Teh!  The host is super helpful and responsive, he even replied us right away and help out at 2 am !!!

Thing to note: suggest you go in a big group/ with male friends as the place is right in the central of the red light distinct, and there is a love hotel right next to it, some rat s on the street at night too. Also, recommend to bring your own towel as the towel provided not very absorbent at al...  and do bring your own tooth paste and hair conditioner - not sure if they are provided in other apartment but not provided at mine."
"J was a great host. He gave us fast respon when we needed it. The place was great, very spacious. Hot water running well, the air con was nice. Small details like many adaptor connector and netflix are very nice. Very recommended"
"J's place was clean, new, convenient and had plenty of room for our family of 6.  J's communication was excellent and the self-check-in was very easy and convenient.  I would definitely stay again."
It__ very clean and convenient. Definitely recommend to all who plan to travel in Singapore.
Perhaps be clear on the surrounding
"Apartment is spacious and clean. Tidy and sufficient for our 2 nights stay. Easy checkin and checkout, be warned that the building is in Red light area. Need to ensure all travellers are ok w this. Otherwise good value as accommodation in Singapore can be pricey."
"J was a very kind, welcoming host. His responses were quick and check-in was a breeze. The area is in the red light district - not a great neighbourhood, but we felt safe. The apartment was very clean and the amenities were decent. The bathrooms didn__ have hand soap and the wifi wasn__ great during our stay, but we really appreciated the US outlet converters and the fact that every room had AC! We mostly used Grab to get around; the apartment is within a 10-15 minutes_ drive to many of the attractions in Singapore.  A good place to stay for groups of 4 or more!"

It is located in a residential area outside of the main downtown area, known to be the __ed light district_, but it felt very safe at all times.  We used Grab (Uber equivalent) to get around, which was easy and convenient.  Just be aware that this apartment is not right in the middle of the more touristy areas so you will need to plan your days, accordingly.  Overall, good value with excellent host."
K's Place in Geylang is in a convenient location across the street from a great supermarket and close to lots of great dining options.  The unit was super clean and the linens were ultra comfortable.  Only one small towel provided per guest; so request more if you plan to swim.  Easy checkin.

Everything is new and very well designed, we enjoyed staying there a lot!
The surrounding has many little places where you can grab a bite and very close by you have a number of buses that take you anywhere you want to go. Any kind of question suggestion or need we had was attended in a brief time span and we were supported to the fullest. 
The pool on the second floor was extremely refreshing in the morning so we spent some time letting the kids get rid of some of their energy in the water."

The condo was exactly as advertised and the pool was great for my son.
"I have to say, Mr. J, the host is super amazing. We booked different floors for our stay due to vacancy, and He helped arrange to the same floor for our entire stay for my family. It was amazing and great experience to stay at Mr. J place. Also, it was so clean and neat. I like the smart TV and my family like it has 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms that have more spaces. This is not enough, Mr. J would answer all kinda questions by messages if you have any. It__ very helpful. Besides, there was a guy who is helping us carry all luggages to taxi. He was so nice for helping us. We just love staying here. If we come here for the visit, this place is no doubt our best option."

Mr. K is very helpful and great in communication. Highly recommend this place if you are coming with your little one.
Amazing apartment. Great rooms with balconies. Comfortable beds and sofa. Good WiFi as well. Loved the kitchen and washer dryer. As a family of 5 we were very comfortable in this space. Loved the dedicated car park and automated check in check out. Real smooth.

Two refrigerators, two kitchens, and two washer/dryer machines made our stay even better than expected. The pool was also clean and of an enjoyable temperature. Location is about a 10-15 minute drive to anywhere in Singapore, and a 15 minute walk from multiple MRT stations. 

Overall, an amazing place to stay with 8 people. Thanks for opening your home to us, and we hope to return!"

"My family was happy staying here for a week. The 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms were pleasantly spacious. Amenities are great, the pool as well. The whole space was very clean and tidy (except for the storage room which we didn't need, though). If anything, the place could use some more inviting decorations to feel a bit more homey.

Check-in went well as we were given all necessary details beforehand. Communication in general was very good. I would definitely consider this again if I have a large number of guests to accommodate."
J__ condo is quite large. It almost feels like 2 condos in 1. Having 2 washer/dryers was very convenient. The wifi is fast with excellent signal. I would recommend staying here. One small thing I would note is if you like hot showers the water only got warm.
"J__ place was perfect for our group of  6 travelers! Plenty of space for everyone, we never felt cramped. Clean and close to public transport if needed. Had a great stay!"

J is also very renponsive to our queries. Overall excellent and highly recommended."
"3days 2 nights stayed in K's was a good decisions. Near the main road that you could easily call the taxi whenever you need. Near the minimart and food stall.

An excellent place to stay for our family trip. Great size for big family of 7 for us. We also enjoyed using the pool and the convenient location walking distance to train and 7 eleven. We loved the cleanliness of the rooms and kitchen bathroom as well as the new clean nature of the building. Good safety given the password locked doors. The WiFi works well also. The host was lovely very fast to reply to queries and even helped to store our luggage since our flight was much later than checkout. Host also gave us an extra hour for checkout which helps always. Thanks again to great place and host.
Thank you K for providing such a super clean entire house and letting us checked in earlier and also checked out a bit late as well. My family loved all the furniture and all equipment in the house that you provided to our needs. Kids also loved the swimming pool as well. Thanks again :)

Perfect place for large group. Value for your money.
Apartment is very good and clean.
This place is super spacious with 4 bedrooms and 3 full bathrooms. There are 2 kitchens with 2 washer/dryer combo. My group really enjoyed staying at this place because it is very close to restaurants nearby with a lot of options. There is also a supermarket and 7-11 nearby. Everything is within walkable distance (5-10min). We were also able to enjoy the pool and everything was just great. There is elevator in the building so traveling with a lot of luggages wasn__ a huge issue. I highly recommend this place and would stay here again.
"The place never fell off our expectations. It was impeccably clean, and SPACIOUS .... check in was easy breezy squeezy... miss K answers all our queries with lightning speed... and really does feel like home away from home. Would recommend it with gusto to future airBnB guests. 
More power to you miss K!!"
Great place for a large group. Relatively convenient with bus stops to places in sg
"Place is great, very clean, even has netflix. Easy to access. For sure will come again."
Really nice place!
A really spacious house which is great for a big family. There's also a lot of food options and buying groceries was a breeze because Sheng Shiong (a local supermarket) was just around the corner
Clean and tidy! Hugeeee place and love the cozyness of it :)
"Wonderful holiday trip. Less than 10 mins walk to kallang mrt which is near the Singapore national stadium. A lovely home that's tastefully decorated and designed. Very accessible to plenty of amenities and highly convenient to travel to! 
I would highly recommend anyone to give this place a go as you won't be disappointed."

"Perfect place for family trip. The apartment is very big, nice & modern decoration, also very clean. The beds were clean & comfy. Check in & check out is very easy. 

The host is super responsive. He informed me about the lift service at our last night, but within an hour it fixed. Very good service ;)

Area is safe for family even some say it__ a redlight district. The nearest MRT is around 900m (Kallang MRT), but the bus stop is very close.

I would highly recommend this apartment & stay again if comeback. 
Thank you for your hospitality ;)"

"We loved staying at J's place!

It was incredibly clean and well furnished. Plus all the little things - the free Netflix, the adaptors, powerboards - really added value and made our stay so easy.

The space is super stylish and well designed and we looked forward to coming home every day! Location is close to amazing food/restaurants.

Highly recommend :)"
"Clean, comfortable and spacious this apartment is just like the photos. 
It's hard to find a place with this much space in Singapore. The pool is nice and nobody else used it as far as we could tell. Beds were comfortable and everything worked well. If you are planning to use the floor mattresses be sure to request them in advance as they are not automatically provided. J responded to all of our messages immediately. Also you should note that this neighborhood is the red light district so if you have children you may wish to avoid this area. Apart from the rampant prostitution it's actually a nice vibrant neighbourhood with lots of good street food and different kinds of people. Like the rest of Singapore the neighborhood felt very safe, though not as clean as other parts."
The bus station is not really far from the house. Need to take a bus ( one stop) to Kallang station ( the nearest Mrt station from the house). The place is kind of convenient while lots of good restarants with resonable price arround.
Had a great time
Very clean and spacious place with good amenities. The pool was a nice added bonus. Would certainly recommend!
Perfect and Clean Place
"This place was amazing! It was super easy to check in to, very clean and very spacious. There was 7 of us and this place was perfect. 

You are located next to Chinatown. It's an hour walk to Clarke Quay, an hour and half to Marina Bay Sands. Or you can jump in a taxi or grab for $15 Singapore dollars and it will take you 10mins. 

There is bus stations and metro stations around the area as well. 

We stay for four days and it was perfect. It's known as the red light district at night and there is a gentlemen club up the street but it never caused us any problems. It's a very ideal location and a great place to stay."
Highly recommended for Singapore stay that are near to city central. House is big and clean! And everything you needed is prepared by the host. Will definitely stay again next time.
spacious
"Awesome apartment, great location! Everything is new here, apartment is spacious and super clean. Location is very convenient, lot's of restaurants around and easy access to busses and taxis. All communication and check in instructions with J super smooth and fast. We were too busy to try out the pool, but it looks great. Would definitively come again, and absolutely recommend this apartment if you're looking a place to stay in SG. Thank you J for a great stay!"

"No doubt it is the best choice if you have a big family staying over in Singapore, everything is within reach and the rooms are comfy"
"First of all, the apartment is very clean and spacious. The host is easy to reach and communicative, when we need to something, he will provide promptly. The swimming pool is nice, most of the time seems like private swimming pool. Overall, everything is beyond my expectation. My family really enjoyed staying here and definitely will be staying here when coming back to Singapore. Thanks K."
The place is worth the money and comfortable and spacious.
Awesome host and very accommodative to my family and very very good communication.
The place is really awesome. Worth every penny. It is convenient with 24hrs supermarket just across the main road and coffeeshops around it. My family really loves it. The place is cosy and I love the fact that it has 2 kitchens. Toilet is clean. I would really love to come back again soon. Thank you once again K for your very fast response. 2 Thumbs up!! I would highly recommend this place.
"We had a pleasant stay. The apartment is very spacious, clean, quiet with all the necessary amenities. The host (Mr. K) is very responsive, I had an issue with gate remote control for entering by car, - Mr. K arranged an additional remote in a matter of an hour despite the late night time."
What a wonderful place to stay and wonderful home. Description is exactly as stated and hospitality was like none other!! Grateful to have had the opportunity to hang out with Mr. J. Very welcoming and extremely generous. Definitely recommend if you are staying in the area - very clean and feels just like being home!
Transportation from airport to the Airbnb was very easy and close. Easily accessible to city with direct bus or taxi car nearby from here. The host also very responsive and kind! Highly recommend this place if you ever want to visit Singapore for vacation :)
good place to stay
Spacious clean accommodation with great facilities
"The airbnb was very nice and looked exactly like the photos. It was very spacious with very fast wifi and a smart tv. It was about a 15 min walk from the subway station and a 15min walk from the Old Airport Road Hawker Centre. The house was spacious and sparkling clean, it had 2 kitchens and 2 laundry washer/dryers. My only recommendation would be to add some more homely decorations to put it over the top. Would definitely stay again. Thank you for your hospitality!"

"This apartment is great. The size is very generous, we were 9 people but you can fit more if you are not picky about sleeping on a mattress. It was shiny clean when we arrived, and it's new and stylish including the 3 large bathrooms. Handy extras like two washing machines and power adaoters for different socket types. Air condition in all bedrooms and the living space, temperature was never an issue. Downstairs is a great private pool area for the building, which was mostly free during our stay. Distance to metro is a bit of a walk, but plenty of options for transportation. J is a great host, always instant positive responses. We had a great time!"

"Very clean, comfortable & __eel at home_ apartment located minutes away from the Suntec city mall; also the starting point for hop on hop off bus. 
Perfect place for a family of 6-8 people. Ample space to move around freely in the apartment. 
A decent mart is just across the road to fetch all your daily needs. Equipped with all modern day amenities. 
J, the host was very prompt in communication. Overall, my group of 6 family members had a very comfortable stay!!"
Great place to stay 
good
one of the best place to stay! will definitely come back again ^^
"Great place for a big group, convenient area with local Delicacies."
Simply a home away from home. Super spacious and well equipped. Will definitely stay again..
"The place is very spacious, clean and comfortable. Located at Geylang which famous for the chinese restaurants spread throughout the neighbourhood. I__ visiting Singapore for a concert so traveling to and back to the Kallang Stadium is a breeze. Highly recommended this place for that kind of trip. 

Check in is super easy, contact with the host is very easy and direct. All in all a very great visit."

"Everything has been seamless from initial discussion, actual stay, up to our check out. Indeed, J was replying fast to any inquiry we will have.

The house was indeed in excellent condition and very spacious, what you see in the pictures would be an actual match to what you will see upon staying!

We will definitely go back and recommend this place to any big group of friends or family that will stay in Singapore. You can go anywhere given it__ accessibility to bus ride going to top destination places."
The place is bigger than i expected. such a huge place for group gathering. The place has everything we needed during the stay. Super good!
Place was exactly as advertised. Great value! Would stay again and recommend to big groups!
"J__ place was fantastic! The apartment is huge, secure and offers plenty of space. It was clean., and offered great amenities. The pool on level 2 is also great."
"This is a fantastic apartment in an amazing location. If you ever want to attend an event at the National Statium or Sports Complex, you should stay here. It's walking distance to the Stadium Complex, and walking distance to all the delicious foods in Geylang -- many of which are open all night. 
The apartment itself is spotless and spacious. We had 6 people spread across 4 bedrooms, and everyone was comfortable."
"This is an awesome homestay which in ever expected.

I am having big family and headache finding an accommodation, apparently this room gives me a very good impression and family enjoy utmost.

Thanks to this homestay make my family trip very pleasant and enjoy full.

Thanks to J for the hospitality.

I will strongly recommend for others."
J__ apartment is a huge and comfortable place to stay. The unit__ location is strategic and surrounded by a lot of restaurants. It__ quite convenience to travel from here to some other places that wish to go. J is a well experiences host. He is very thoughtful and kind in helping us during our stayed. Highly recommended for a big group of family
"J is great and so is the place. Its located in Geylang so it's not CBD but travel downtown is quite fast if you take a grab.

Place itself is all you need for a group stay. If you are travelling in a big group and dont need to be smack downtown this this I definitely where you should stay. We were a group of 10 and there was more than enough space."
"We loved the place; it__ spacious and comfortable, would really recommend for big families with kids. The neighbourhood area is also very convenient, easy access with variety of restaurants nearby. J was very helpful whenever we__e in need during our stay here :)"
"The apartment was bigger than expected, with a big living room and dining area, and enough space for kids to run. 
The host was really responsive and helpful, such as finding us a bigger dining table to accommodate us. 
The neighborhood is interesting, with eating options at any time of the day and night. 
I would recommend the place."
"Our family had a great stay. Unit was huge, clean and spacious for our big group of 10 pax. We were even welcomed with Champagne and sodas for the holidays and we super appreciated the quick responses to all of our queries and all the smooth encounters. :)"
"The venue is really spacious, very clean, it was just a bit of a walk to public transport. However overall it was a good experience staying there, the responses from owner are also real quick which had made our checking in and out of the venue very convenient."
"Hassle-free, convenient comfy place. Exciting location, lots of discoveries. Great for tourist who wants to explore the diversity of Singapore."

Feel like home 
Great apartment. A close walk to MRT and plenty of restaurant and hawker centre. Very comfortable apartment with lots of great features.
"The neighborhood is quiet and it's one of the less crowded areas in Singapore, but at the same time, you can get to access the central area really fast. The hosts have been wonderful; very quick response and they always did their best to solve any kind of difficulties."
Clean and cosy! lovely neighbourhood.
"Nice, stylish and brand new look place to stay as couple or small family and is convenient to go town as is located in the middle.Nicholas is very friendly and fast responsive to all my queries especially during the check in. Will plan and come back again for next stay.Overall is awesome"
Great location! Very clean and super responsive host!
"Well maintained house. The locality is good except that on the ground floor of the building, it is a little messy. Amenities are very good. Very comfortable stay."
"Place is in a very convenient and accessible location, very cosy and pretty space fit for couples or even just 1 person. Really enjoyed myself for the week. Thank you! :)"

Clean and quiet. Even it's a hostel but still suitable for families
nice place to stay and very comfortable
"everything was great, especially the very helpful staff, location was great too, lots of cafes and food stalls around, close to MRT station and also a shopping mall, the bathroom was clean enough, the soundproof wall was better than I thought. The only drawback was that we couldn't connect to the Wi-Fi from our rooms, which were probably due to our room being at the far end of the corridor on the 3rd floor. Well, anyway, we had a great stay, would recommend it to anyone who is looking for cheaper but better accomodation in Singapore :)"
The hostel was better than I expected. The staff were very helpful too in giving local tips. My family had a great time in Singapore and saved a lot of money staying in the hostel! I would highly recommend this and will surely come back .

"Had a wonderful stay at this wonderful and well located hostel. The staff are friendly, helpful and hospitable. They were very pleasant to interact with and helped us with anything we needed. Breafast are for free and also near to malls and MRT. This hostel is highly recommended. "
Overall a good experience
Very good experience. My family of 6 had a private room the first 2 nights and it was great. The hostel found a space for us the third night because I booked the incorrect dates. They graciously found space in the capsule rooms. While the capsule bed room was a good place to stay and everything was good I don__ recommend the capsule room for families as it is shared with other people.
The place was very convenient and easily accessible. The host was very cooperative and clear with the explanation. The bathroom was superb in terms of cleanliness and the atmosphere was very quiet and calm. So yeah very much recommend this!
A good place who wants a stay that is not so far away from the city and not in a noisy neighbourhood
Good price
It's good for backpacker. :)
"Staying at this hostel was very affordable and met our expectations. Our room was clean and the lobby looked very cool. We were satisfied with our stay for the most part. If you want to drop off your luggage before checking in, be sure to do it before 11 am or after 2 pm because the receptionist won__ be there in between these hours."
Good little apartment in an excellent location. Perfect place to use when relocating to Singapore or while staying on business. Appliances are all very new and the whole place is newly renovated. My only caution is that there__ only one small window at the back of the apartment so it can feel very dark. But it__ still a great choice in Tiong Bahru and I__ stay again given the chance.
"The rooms : This studio is as expected in the pictures clean and well furnished. The appliances are new and well maintained and there are cutlery and utensils for cooking with. The bedroom has the only window in the house but with the curtains drawn there's enough light for the bedroom. The bed is comfortable and has storage space under it for suitcases. 

The service : Team Jay managing the house were very communicative starting before check in till after check-out and very responsive to questions and requests. My only complaint was with the weekly cleaning where sometimes trash wasn't taken out or the bed not made or just the bare minimum done. This made me quite annoyed one night but they were quick to respond back to my request for a re-cleaning.

The location : Super close to the good parts of tiong bahru and a bus-stop connecting many parts of the city. And there are many restaurants and cafes nearby. I didn't see any supermarkets nearby however, but there probably is one. 

Overall, this studio was great for my solo 1 month stay and I would recommend it for someone looking to stay in the city for a short term."
"Everything is good, just a bit far to the metro station."
Great!
"Lovely location - tiong Bahru is an awesome and cozy neighborhood and still quite close to CBD. Unfortunately no gym or pool to use, so rather recomendable for a shorter stay (1-2 weeks). Host was always reachable, very responsive!"
Cozy and convenient
Awesome place! Great location and communications!
Great place to stay for a short-term. In an excellent location where you can have local food and other types of restaurants. Host response very quickly to all your questions. Recommended!
"Perfect location, very modern design and clean. The building also has an elevator which is very convenient for taking your suitcases. We had a wonderful stay here!"
"It was a nice home away from home. Clean place, clean sheets, modern furnishing."
"Great place. I love that there was soap and other small amenities like detergent and dishwashing liquid making my stay Soo much easier.
I recommend this place!"
"This is a very nice studio with all the basic amenities, including your own washing machine! I very much felt at home there. It is very conveniently located in the heritage neigborhood of Tiong Bahru, with the Tiong Bahru Food Market just around the corner. Communication with the host was smooth."
This has been our second stay under Yee__ units . Couldn__ expect for more coz it__ beyond perfection. Best place to stay for short/long term.
Very clean and cosy place!
Nice cosy apartment that has all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay.
Everything's good
Thank you for your hospitality
"Place is clean and good location, 5 min walk from the MRT. Lot's of food choices around and walking distance to tiong bahru market. The apartment is very well equipped."
Very Recomended 
"Great little apartment in a fantastic location, was clean with easy check in and communication is very easy with the host."
"Perfect for 1 or a couple, cosy spot, host and team very professional and prompt, smooth check in and out. Lots of food spots and supermarkets nearby. And close to the river for some evening scenery. I would recommend this place!"
"Perfect location, very easy to get around with public transportation and walking distance to plenty of food eateries. Place is great, very clean and has almost everything you need. Host was also very helpful since the beginning, available at all times whenever I had any questions. Totally recommend it."
"Great little place, Tiong Bahru market and Rob Quay nearby! Very clean"
We had a very comfortable and enjoyable stay. All the amenities were within walks and the ST team were very prompt and ready to assist. Would totally come back to stay in the future. Highly recommend!

Everythings perfect
Very clean and well furnished place.
Very convenient and centrally-located place! It's also near some of my favourite restaurants so managed to go out and eat at those places and just walk back. Very private and secure too. Sparkling clean place.
"A nice, fully equipped place for a longer stay. The amenities are new&in good condition. The communication with the host was smooth & check in and check out were quick and easy.
Really good value for the money in this hip neighbourhood."
"Great 2nd stay at this place! Its location just beside my favourite restaurants, cafes and bars make it a memorable stay. It's cosy, clean, and everything I need is available."
"9 Day stay. Excellent place very well located. Easy access to the market and plenty of restaurants around. Bus stop right in front and short walk to MRT station. Comfortable bed,  nice shower. Enjoyed having the kitchen essentials. Wifi worked perfectly. Very awesome and helpful host."
"I spent two weeks at this Airbnb. The owner was super fast to respond, they will accommodate you if you have any questions."
Fantastic place! Recommended
I enjoyed my stay at the apartment especially as it is located near cute cafes and lovely places to sit and watch the world go by. The apartment itself is small and cosy but has all the amenities you need! The host was contactable by text whenever I needed anything and the apartment was cleaned on a weekly basis. A pleasant stay all round!
Great place

The pace is located in a great area of Singapore.  Within walking distance you can get to great cafes and restaurants and have easy access to get to other places centrally.  The place is very clean and modern.  The team is very responsive.  Great place!
"Accommodation is maintained well and very clean. The location is also convenient where you can get hawker meals and cozy restaurants within minutes walk. It is not far from MRT Tiong Bahlu. Bas stop is also nearby to go somewhere. If you have something to ask, you would get quick response via (Hidden by Airbnb) ."
Convenient location.
Definitely will Recommend it to friends
Outstanding host
I love how the host will help to make sure your stay is pleasant! Will definitely go there for my stay again!
Super convenient place in Outram. Amazingly comfortable bed! Close to central Singapore. I'll be staying here again when I'm next in Singapore.
I still love this place even after my second time! Below has great food and love how relax you feel at the place! I will definitely choose the same place if I needed a break again!
"A super lovely stay! Place is clean, comfy, and fill with the necessities. I was serving SHN with my another friend here for a week and we are super glad to stay in this place. Host is very responsive during our stay. Everything is just nice! Recommend to everyone! :)"
quiet and clean place! well equipped with basic amenities . highly recommended for long term stay (able to wash clothes and cook)
Happy with my stay.
"staying at your place from 17th till 24th October..we are glad with your cleanliness,the shower water flow,toiletries,the towels provided,the washing machine,the parking, locations is very pleasant and modern looking place...thumbs up n hope you will maintain all (Website hidden by Airbnb) i might stay again n choose your place...highly recommended..congrats"
The apartment was very clean and spacious. The air conditioning in all rooms helped keep the whole apartment very cool and comfortable. Yee and his team were very responsive and made the check-in process easy. We were able to text him at any time with questions or requests and he was very prompt in replying.
"Though We have booked at a very last minute , the team was so helpful to assist us on all the check in procedures . Such a cozy stay for 7 days. We wanted to extend , but unfortunately its fully booked on the date that we require. We really enjoyed the stay as it__ wayyyy toooo convenient for us as it come with kitchen , washing machine and etc. The best stay so far "
Very responsive. No fuss. Despite the circuit breaker was very helpful in any way he can.
The location and amenities are great. Good food is barely a 2 min walk away. The apartment is clean and there is a weekly cleaning service which was nice. The hosts are very responsive.
Very stylish space and a stone throw away from hip Tiong Bahru. Highly recommended if you need to separate your work space and bed room.
"Yee's apartment is one of the few in its price class that is well equipped, located and was big enough to live and work during the circuit breaker.  The only small critique are the frosted windows that block your view. We will for sure recommend it on our travel tips website (Website hidden by Airbnb)"

"It is a really nice apartment and relatively spacious for the price. The kitchen is fully equipped, the bathroom stylish and the bed very comfy.
The only improvement would be to change the iced windows as they give it a bit of a basement feeling."
I booked it for my uncle and aunt. They said it was a nice place.
Great Stay at a good pricing!
Stylish modern flat.  Very quiet.  Very responsive host.
"place is sparkling clean, location are great! def coming back to stay."
Good
very nice place and value for money!
"Simple design and brand new amenities, well equipped kitchen for simple cooking. A lots of eateries within a short walk. Very responsive host.

Frosted window blocked the view and make it feels like you are trapped inside...ventilation is not very good, air is dry.

Overall, is a good place for a short-stay."
Great Place!
Great location and amenities. Highly recommended.
"Place is good location everything is accessible like food , restaurants , location good,"
"Very responsive communication, clean and good location"
Perfect for lingers stays while you look for accommodation in Singapore.
"The Shophouse co-living spaces are a super charming series of houses and I loved my stay here! Shuying's hospitality is wonderful - she was so helpful in organizing this stay for my first six months in Singapore, and it was wonderful to meet so many great people through the Shophouses (facilitated by Shuying of course!). The space is stylish, very comfortable, and perfectly spacious. It could not be better located in the heart of Singapore, in what is a very cool upcoming district between Lavender and Farrer Park. There are great coffee shops around too ;) I would recommend this suite and all of Shuying's other listings wholeheartedly."
"The Malvern Suite was cozy and convenient. The suite is in one of Singapore's beautiful historical shophouses, which is well maintained with modern touches and tasteful furnishing. The hosts were very accommodating, and the location makes it a good base to explore Little India."
"Its near of Masjid Sultan, and halal food stores. Clean and friendly hospitality. Its a self service. Good overall."
Nice backpacker hostel in a very convenient location (close to Bugsi station). You share the bathroom and showers with the other guests but there are enough available so you never have to wait
"Reception staff was very friendly and helpful. Cleanliness in common areas i.e. pantry and bathrooms was well maintained by the staff. No funky smells or many pest insects/critters spotted.

It is in a very convenient location as the nearest MRT station (Bugis) is about a 5-min walk away with many food and shopping outlets nearby. However there are a couple of night clubs within the vicinity of the accommodation that may be noisy depending on the room you get. I booked a private room for 2 and wasn't disturbed by any noise.

The rooms are small but nothing outside of expectation as it is the case with all hostels in Singapore. Self-service laundry is available and also a small patio area on the second floor for sun-drying your clothes."
Overpriced and understaffed. No wonder I barely saw any other guests
Excellent option in Kampong Glam

"Very clean and comfortable space in a great location and just a few minutes walk from an MRT station.

The hosts are very professional, friendly and accommodating.

I highly recommend them."
"Una estancia muy agradable y la chica que nos atendiÃ³ encantadora.
100% recomendable"
"Many people have never lived in a shophouse including locals, it was a nice experience and a pleasure to stay vs typical hotels. Well located for public transport within short distance for train to Orchard (or to the airport!), walk to into the heart of Chinatown in few minutes, safe neighbourhood and certainly value for money."
"Stylish room, great location, friendly and kind service!
Perfect 100 to your studios!"
"Quiet big room,clean and good circulation.  Complete facilities! you got refrigator also electric kettle and tea/coffee stuff in the room. all you need for stay is there. also very near from bus stop and convenience store. i like it better than hotel, bcs you dont need elevator each time you want to got out!"

"Very clean and a good size for 2 people, well equipped with amenities for my short stay. Location is very good if you mostly go around Chinatown or Marina Bay Sands, pretty convenient for MRT transfers. Ask for food recommendations for great noms! :)"
"Great place to stay in Singapore, especially regarding its price! Lynda is a very nice host and provided helpful regommendations."
"Cresa__ flat is very well located near Chinatown; any closer and you would pay double the price, so this is a great bargain. The renovation of the historic property was impeccable. The current condition was spotless and well stocked with amenities. Nighttimes it was quiet, its shower reliable and bed firm but comfortable. Also Cresa was readily available at my late arrival and very friendly during the check-in. There were only two sour notes. First, at check in, Cresa required a passport check, in contrast to every other AirBNB (more than 50) in which we__e stayed over the last seven years, including another Singapore AirBNB at which I__ stayed a month prior. Second, there are a lot of CCTV cameras inside the building, with one in particular pointed directly at my bedroom door, which was disconcerting."
10/10 would recommend. Only downfall is you can easily hear what goes on outside your room
"Great services, good location!"
"GREAT EXPERIENCE!! Host was absolutely amazing. Quick responses, excellent local recommendations. Great location. Would highly recommend!"

"The location was ok ! You can find some MRT stations around. 

But the bed was sooooo hard. I couldnt sleep well.

The aircon is pushing the cold air directly to you when u are sleeping. I think you should change the position of the bed. I was ill because of that."
"Nice and clean place, check in was a breeze. 
Lynda provided me with lots of helpful local tips. Will stay here again the next time I am in Singapore."
"Great host and a nice room. Keyless entry was convenient, as well as proximity to subway and taxies."
The location is perfect for exploring the city. The bed was comfy. It was a bit bad that there is no real window in the room so you can not check the weather. But everything else was fine.
"Its a very comfortable studio! All facilities and amenities are well prepared. Very near to Outram MRT, its only less than 5 minutes walking distance. Somemore this is an interchange station, can access to every places! Also near to Universe Studio! We explored there__ some cafes nearby too, had our brunch at Populus cafe. Would definitely love to stay again when we want to visit SG!"

Die Unterkunft ist sehr sauber, inklusive kleinem KÃ¼hlschrank, Wasserkocher und somit der MÃ¶glichkeit morgens einen Kaffee/Tee zu machen. Die Kommunikation verlief vollkommen problemlos und sowohl ein spÃ¤ter Check-in als auch ein sehr frÃ¼her Check-out (auf Grund des Fluges) waren kein Problem. Wir kommen sehr gerne wieder!"
"Message reply was really fast.
No need of physical key to open de doors. (very practical!)
Everything worked well just like was supposed to be.
A good, basic simple space. Kind of place that I would like to return."
"I was quite a nice stay here, even my Singaporean friends were surprised that I could found such a nice place. The room was clean and with heritages style, it is just in downtown and you can go anywhere freely. The host was also very helpful and can always respond to your requirements instantly."

Our Airbnb was clean and was the perfect amount of space for two people! Keypad locks made it convenient since we didn't need to carry around keys with us. Smooth check-in process since they were ready to check us in as soon as we arrived.

"Great host, waited up to our heavily delayed flight. Fast answers and everything was neat and tidy. Thanks for your hospitality. We will come back for sure!"
"Great little space in a good part of town. Two codes needed to get into the apartment. The apartment is one of four (I think) in a traditional style Singaporean house. Noise pollution was noticeable, but it wasn__ anything crazy. Overall the place was great. It was clean, spacious (for 2), easy to get to, had a nice AC system, plenty of outlets and lights, and a good bathroom. Nothing to complain about except for a bit of noise! I__ stay here again in the future."
"I loved staying at the Studios. Lynda__ quick responses made booking and staying super easy. The studio was spacious and had all amenities to make it feel like home. The convenience of the location was an absolute bonus - particularly the  bus routes! My only regret is that I didn__ get to stay in Singapore longer, but I spos it gives me a reason to come back. Thanks again!"
"This is the ultimate location to stay. It is on a party street which makes it a very fun and lively environment and it__ in walking distance to so many things. I__ someone that prefers a taxi but I spent almost a whole morning walking around to tourists spots so it__ very doable. There is lost of privacy and security, you choose your own combo for your locker. It was a pain to have to pass through reception to get my clothes/toiletries and then go back through to go to the showers. Very clean, fairly quiet considering the location. Finding it may be difficult  but typing in __ircle house_ is your best bet "
Good
Good for solo travelers who want a quick and easy place in the heart of the city.
Capsules were really quiet. I heard my neighbor getting into his pod but I didn't hear him at all during the night although he was right above me.
Clean Hotel. Good location. But the pod's aircon is really loud. Also the door is noisy.
Definitely worth the cost. Amazing location and satisfactory cleanliness.
"Located in the center of the city, it is very close to the scenic spots. Convenient transportation and beautiful environment."

Nice place
"Good- Location, beds, safety, check-in, bathrooms

Bad- could have been a bit cleaner (just the floors) but still good for hostel cleanliness"
Really nice amenities and a perfect location. Only problems that we encountered was the non stop beeping of the door not being closed and some temper tantrums from kids. Definitely a great place to stay if your looking for a family filled hotel.
This place was in the perfect location! Right next to the river with countless amounts of options for food. Not far from the MRT which was nice. The lounge area had 24/7 coffee and biscuits with comfortable seating. The cube itself was a little smaller than expected. The bed was too large for the cube so to shut the door quietly was a challenge. The security was great and the staff was always smiling and making sure you were happy.
"The place was what it was with their picture posted. I loved the lady who was helping during breakfast. She was very accommodating. Also, the other lady at the front desk who has a colored hair, she is also accommodating. The other girl, not so much accommodating, you__l see her face reaction when you ask something that is not very welcoming. But the guy who was also in front desk was good too. The cleanliness of the place was good. Loved all interior. Loved the free breakfast and the unlimited coffee and water of this place. The place was near two MRT__ so that is good. Can be easily found on (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps. We had a good stay here."
Okay
Fun little capsule hostel! Front desk was always present and responsive. Location was fantastic and we loved our stay.
Es lo que se ve en las fotos. Comodo hasta donde un hostal puede llegarlo a ser. Muy querida la gente que estaba en la recepcion.
"If you__e a foodie, be sure to check this place out cos there__ quite a number of local food around the area!!"
Dans l__nsemble nous avons passÃ© 2 nuits agrÃ©ables dans un environnement atypique.
"Staff were lovely but the room was very hot so we had to kept the door open and with guests making the usual noises we got little or no sleep. 
There needs to be better vents for each bedroom."
"Great place, location. Price matches value. First experience in a capsule and it was really cool. Friendly staff."
Very nice place and well located. You can walk all around the city and staying in a very central place
"perfect location and nice staff. the hotel had everything we needed and the capsules were really comfortable. the room in which the capsules are located is a little smelly. however, we had a pleasant stay"

Very nice location and clean place. Sorry for the late check out. Thank you
"Zoe & Friends were very helpful and accommodated us just hours before scheduled check in. What a huge relief it was to us to find a home to stay at in SG in such short notice!

The space was very large for 7 people, very clean, and situated at a very convenient and accessible location. 

We highly recommend staying at Zoe__ & Friends in SG. We will choose to stay at their place again, given the chance."

The host is responsive. The listing is big and really close to a lot of restaurants and shopping malls. Pool area is also really nice!
Conveniently located near the MRT station and food outlets are within walking distance. Easy check-in process and the apartment is well maintained.
"Great hosts who are helpful and responsive. Even though there were some minor issues encountered, they were able to rectify it promptly. A good stay at a good price and location!"

"The rooms were clean and the beds were done perfectly. It's very close to the bus stand and easy to go arnd city. It value for money and worth the stay.

Confirmed properly the address
It is a pleasant stay. Quiet and clean place with a responsive and friendly host.
Amit is a very friendly host. Location is very close to the airport. No-frills setup best for overnight layover. Thanks Amit!
"Very near the airport, for me, a stop over is convenient with MRT with 2 stops and a Bus with 3 stops.  Amit doesn__ give out his address because he said GPS might take me to a different location which caused me anxiety, not to mention what I had to fill out on immigration form. At the end, Amit met me at the bus stop at almost 10PM!!"
Ok
Okay place for solo traveler on a budget
Only if you badly need a room to sleep and you are in a tight budget.
"I had a comfy stay at Amit__ place. He was very accommodating and responded quickly to my queries.  His place is just right for solo travellers! Place was clean and close to the airport. Til next time Amit, thank you so much for your hospitality!m and kindness!!! "
Nice place for budget traveller.
"amit is a nice person,fast response and always give advice where i should find things !"
Good for a short trip
Photos shown different from reality
"All in all, it was as expected, and for my purposes adequate since I was only there to sleep. Bed was a bit creaky, and the room is a bit musty with no natural light. Shower might be a bit of an issue for some, and there's no way I'd consider bringing the wife there, but for a lone male working in Singapore for a day or 2 it's fine. Definitely not ideal for a woman, as the access is across an open area with no lighting at night. Right on the bus routes, though a bit of a trek onto the MRT."
Great place for affordable stay in Singapore
"Very affordable place in a good location. Helpful and communicative host, would recommend!"
"Lots of flexibility.
Friendly host.
Quick to response."
A good and clean place that is close to an airport.
Amit Place is totally clean while im staying. Easy access for transportation.
"Amit was awesome. 
I needed an inexpensive place for a few weeks. He kept the place clean and was helpful with directions and food locations. 
My first time with Airbnb but Amit made me feel comfortable. I work downtown and he allowed me to drop off my luggage very early on check in so I would not have to take to work. 
Thank You Amit"
the best place for solo traveller. thank you mr amit
"The place was too old, NOT clean and much lower than standards."
"Nice location, close to the airport. A kilometer to either MRT station, but the bus stops are all very close and easy to get where one needs to go. Amit is very nice and I enjoyed chatting with him. I even got a special meal my second night which was really delicious and saved me from having to go out to eat somewhere, especially since I was really tired that day. I would stay here again."
"Thanks to Amit. He switch on almost all the light in house as he knows I will have very late check in.
He even didn__ forget to arrange a pair of slipper standby, in front of my room.
Thanks for detail considerate arrangement for a one night stay guest, Amit."
"Singapore is expensive and so trying to look for a private place was daunting but when I found Amit__ room.  It was perfect and I was wishing I stayed longer. Close to the bus stop.  Directions on how to get to his place, very quick to respond when you__e trying to find his place.  Really nice guy and place is everything you need if you__e looking for a cheap solid option in the land of crazy rich asians.  Loved it and would stay again in a heartbeat"
Great
"Thanks to Amit for being a great host. Being a first timer in Singapore, got a lot of help from him in terms of commute and local tips. The place was clean and well connected by Bus & MRT."
"The host is very kind, welcoming and always prompt to reply for any requests. Thank you Amit!"
"Great place to stay! I had a little bit of a hard time finding it because I came at night, but it is easy to spot during the day. Quick responses from host and Amit is very helpful :)"
"This place is located on a small hill. If you are carrying heavy stuff, it is gonna be hard. house has a bit weird smell. My mom woke up early coz landlord was watching movie and laughing really loud. If you are a single guy and looking for a place to sleep a night, I recommend this place.  This place not bad and also not very good. Cheers!"
Listing is accurate. Very smooth experience. Good & fast communication. A+ would stay again.
Value for money. Located well. Hawker center and shopping street nearby. Bus station near the house connects directly to ChangiBusinessPark. Got quick response from Amit. Frequent cleaning would have been great.
Decent place to stay. Quiet and able to get work done if you need to.
An instant place to stay at! Quick responses from the host made the experience more pleasant.
Fairly good
Quiet place to rest
Value for money and a warm host
Amit was very good and helped me with my stay
Amit is a good host
"1.No frills  and a basic place to relax and chillout..
2. you can smoke and drink your favourite alchohol here. 
3. we are able to use the living area 
4. Very responsive and friendly host 
5. A good  and value for money place for non fussy guests only"
The room was cozy and comfortable. Convenient check in and check out system. The property owner was very kind and responsive. Plus the location is great near to convince store and market. I really enjoyed staying there.
Great location with many local eating spots nearby. Overall good experience :)
Great place to stay for short trips or extended stays. Great location. Plenty of places to eat nearby and short walk to bus stops and MRT station. Would definitely stay here again.
"She was very helpful, the place was so nice for a extended stay if you like to cook, feel at home on the road etc. very easy to get around since MRT station is just like 5 minutes by walking."
"Quite area even though its beside a MRT station (about 5mins walk). Spacious and clean room and bathroom. Good Wi-Fi connection. No local channels were available to us though. When asked about it we were told that we would have to shift room. After climbing 3 floors with our luggage and unpacking, we didn't want to shift again. (Do double check with them on the channels)  Oh yeah there is no lift! Very polite host and they did their very best to cater to my last minute requests. Will definitely want to stay here again."

Everything great! Clean and big space
The room was lovely and sparkling clean.
"Good location, with walking distances to public transport and local eateries nearby. Unit facilities is working well and self sufficient,  there is cafe and restaurants below the unit.
 
However, unit is above flight of stairs and is tiring for aged people especially for higher floors.

Good location for short term stays."
a plesent studio. clean and tidy.
Location is very accessible to food shop and transport. The only glitch is the TV is unable to use without using your own USB for some movie or entertainment in the room. Otherwise you just have to sleep.
"Everything was exceptional. The unit was very clean and the host was truly nice. We very enjoyed our stay there. The room was better than expected, nicer than the pictures provided on the website. The location is also great, bus station and MRT station are just few minutes walk so you can get through everywhere in Singapore."
"Highly Recommended. Good value for money, clean and fantastic place with easy access into downtown Singapore. Just remember to bring your own shampoo."

If you are a light sleeper, the noise from the street and the water draining in the bathroom may be a bit loud for you."
Just what I expected. Nice and cozy. Very close to the MRT station and hawkers.
"Everything was quite well but if there was something to change about it, I would recommend changing the size of the bathroom as it was too small."
What a great hospitality
Excellent Host and lovely place to live. Sunny is very responsive and helpful. The place was amazing to stay at with abundant high quality amenities and facilities. Would definitely choose Sunny again

The place is exactly the same as in the pictures. The neighborhood is quiet and just walking distance from restaurants and a grocery store. 5 mins walk going to a train station. What I appreciate most is the host's responsiveness. Easy to communicate with. We had a very pleasant stay.
Great for the price.
"Sophie's place was nothing short of perfect.. the area is quiet and beautiful_ The place is very roomy and feels like home. Clean home and well equipped. We stayed for 8 days  with a young family. Children loved the pool as well as other things available. The area is easy to get to by public transport and by Uber/MRT/Taxi.. it's close to most of the tourist__ attractions. There is a food places with delicious various types of food open till late just around the area, there are cafes and grocery stores within walking distance. The location is in one of the most convenient streets with the possibility to visit nearby local coffee shops and restaurants. Its spacious and modern. The description in AirBNB is accurate, all pics are real and new. The place is stylish. Internet is fast and reliable. All appliances work and it even has a washing machine. Check in was very smooth and they provided all the instructions to follow. The communication with Sunny was always super fast and friendly! I would definitely recommend this apartment and we will book it again when we are back."
Simple place (with pool access) but very convenient location to visit Singapore. The place offers enough space for a small family. Sunny was very reactive to all our questions.
"Great space with Swimming pool just right outside the corridor. Room is clean. James responded to any of my enquiry and allowed us to check-in later than expected, even keep track to know whether we have already checked in although it was already late. "
"Host is very prompt in replies and check in if everything is going smoothly. Had to stay for an additional night, and host was very patient and agreed readily. Got a unit that was slightly different from photos, though similar. But only one bedroom had private bathroom instead of both as there were only 2 toilets instead of 3. Apart from that all is good. Thank you!"

Quaint two bedroom apartment in quiet neighborhood. Easy access to two MRT stations and buses. Lots of decent restaurants within a few minutes walk.
"Near from MRT, room has window (which most of budget hotels in Singapore does most provide that), neighbourhood is quite safe. Dongsu gave us privacy. Would definitely come back."
"Amazing place... Had a lott of ameneties. Refrigerator, kettle , Ac in room. Washrooms clean and kept well. They changed the towels twice during our 4 day stay."

Nice place
Alfred responded very quickly to an urgent request for accommodation. The place is nice and clean.
"_¿å_å¾_¹²_,ä½_½®ä¹___¹ä¾¿ï½"
"Awesome, clean, friendly!"
"Alfred place is a nice place as its near to 4 malls , Mrt Station and the hospital.  
There is a Bus stop right below.  
Me being a OCD person had some issues with the cleanliness but i have update Alfred on it.  
Alfred is very welcoming , friendly and nice.  
Check in and Check out was easy.  
Thank you so much Alfred."
The apartment is in a great location. It is only 5min away from Novena mrt station and 2min from the neareast bus stop. Check in and check out is very easy and Alfred the host offered us a personal greeting even though we checked in after midnight. The room is exactly as in the photos with spacious bedroom and kitchen. There is even a small studio with working table. Alfred is very responsive too. I would definitely stay here again next time I visit Singapore.
"This unit is just abt 3-5mins walk to Novena MRT station, malls, hospitals & a bus away to the nearest Whampoa Market & Foodcourt! We love the location! Be reminded tho, this unit is not up for cooking, only boiling is allowed.  In addition, the entire unit are covered with glass windows & arent_ locked, kids can open it easily, thus you may want to be cautious of that.

Meantime, i believe the cleanliness & maintainance of the furniture can be much improved."
"Will definitely recommend! Alfred was very helpful with swift reply, great location within walking distance to MRT station and comfortable."
"Great location and nice host,easy to communicate with but he can be cranky,day of check in, he was late,day of checkout,we agreed on a 1pm check out, however the next day host just barged into the house while we were bathing after cleaning up the place for him. what if my wife was not dressed properly?The bed, pillows, wifi and aircon are in bad shape, aircon is very old and broke down, pillow stuffings are squashed up and not nice to sleep in,wifi is not stable and slow."
"Thanks Alfred for the host! The place is amazing and as host himself, the respond is speedy! Would highly recommend his place to all especially for couples! Such a amazing unit, cozy yet comfortable stay. Will definitely recommend to all my friends too!"
Nice place with good location!
Great stay and great view
Nice room. Not far from MRT.

Just like on the photos. It__ a simple and comfortable place. The location isn__ super central however the mrt farrer park is close so it__ convenient. Definitely great location if you enjoy late night food as little India area is walking distance.

"It's a beautiful room, very spacious in the Singapore context, the outdoor terrace is very nice overlooking a big green area. Location is wonderful, very close to MRT and little india, all the good food! I will definitely stay again."
"Really nice & clean place, also with wonderful terrace."
"Great hospitality.  independent entrance. Clean, close to MRT station, quite place. 
Everything was perfect."
"It__ a very convenient location (I used to live at potong Pasir in the past so was used to the farrer park surrounding). By far the prettiest house in this area. Difficult to find as 70a is shown on the map to be somewhere else. Very clean and fast answers. Private bath. However would recommend to switch the bed to the other side to not be confronted directly with the aircon. I really liked that place. Just one more thing to note: there__ a door in this room pointing outside where you don__ know where it is leading to. As a female solo Traveller I felt a bit uncomfortable at night sometimes due to this, as i also haven__ met anyone living in this house or the helper until my very last day."
"It is a nice and well decorated apartment, with sufficient space. It is a little bit difficult to find the exactly location first time in the night, it is located in the end of Sing ave, much closer to exit B of Farrer Garden station. The house keeper will help for laundry, and Catherine responded quickly. Very valuable choice for staying at Singapore."
"I really enjoyed my stay. The bedroom is nicer in person than in the pictures, and the apartment is modern, functional, and just 5 min walking to the nearest the train station."
"Nice apartment
Clean
Centre of singapore"

"Catherine's place room F is of surprising and outstanding quality in every aspect. Room design and decor, attention for details, cleaningness, hospitality and service of caretaker Lien. Furthermore it is comfortly located near MRT Farrer Park with fast connections to the major interesting parts of Singapore. We enjoyed every bit of our stay and will certainly book again on a next occasion."
"Great stay. A bit hiccup with the lock, but help was prompt. Overall good experience."

It's very convenience to go to the MRT. and the room is big enough for two people who are living in.
eveything is perfect. the place is clean. very comfy bed
"This is an amazing stay in Singapore. For independent people, it is as good as it gets.

The room is spacious, modern and has a huge wardrobe to organize your belongings in. AC and ceiling fan work together to keep the temperature down. The wifi was mentioned in the listing and I want to praise it for being fast and reliable. The private bathroom is fully stocked and very clean, I was happy to find even a toothbrush. 

The shared kitchen corner is sufficient to prepare meals. Pan, pot, microwave, kettle, fridge and freezer - the basics are more than covered. I should mention that the room itself also has a decent sized fridge. Incredibly neat. 

It's a perfect location for extended stays and people that don't have to rush from one tourist stop to the next. The property is tucked into a quiet side street away from noise and traffic, but Farrer Park Station is less than 5 min away. A shopping center and food court are within 10 minutes walking distance. Local shops and restaurants are right around the corner. 

Lastly I want to mention that the host and her team are good people. Communication with them was always fast and friendly, and the service they offered made me feel at home. I miss this place already."
Nice place to stay. Clean and peaceful .
"PrÃ¨s de la Little India, propre et communication facile avec Anabel. Merci !"
"I like Diane's place - old charm, great location close to foods and transport. Checking in and out were a brisk. Was there only for 2 nights and mostly out in the morning and back late night to sleep. The place was what I needed and would recommend it to work travellers."
Clean room and near a metro station. From this station you can quickly get to most of singapore. Nice and affordable place to stay if you want to explore singapore.
"pleasant stay.
thank you Diane and Anabel."
"A very nice place with a private bathroom, so convenient
Provide refrigerator and kettle
And near to the downtown area and mrt 
thanks to anbel and Diane,hope to visit again"
"Chambre simple mais fonctionnelle.
Les indications de Diane ont Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s prÃ©cises.
TrÃ¨s bon rapport qualitÃ© prix."
Alles war in Ordnung! Preis Leistung stimmt!
Great location and clean space.
Very conveniently located accommodation for people with limited time and a lot to do. Thanks Annabel for assisting us to store our bags before and after our stay. Diane was also great at giving directions to the accommodation before we arrived so we knew exactly where we were going via public transport.
"Very nice location, near little India. It was really easy to check in, especially since we can let the luggage even if the room is not ready. Thank you!"
"Dianes place is very conveniently located near the Little India MRT stop. The bed is comfy and the AC is nice and cold. The water gets hot and has great pressure, but can leak out the shower door a bit.
Staying here made it very easy to explore downtown Singapore!"
"Perfect stay! It is located not far from little India, the room was clean and there's air conditioning which was great. Would highly recommend to other guests!"

Diane__ place is exactly as per the descriptions and photos. A good value place to stay in central Singapore. Would stay there again.
Good location
"Our stay was comfortable. Anabel, the helpful live in house manager, is a sweetie, and loves to sing. My couple of comments to help future guests: 1) when you exit the MRT at little india double check for exit A before you swipe out, otherwise you will get stuck on the wrong side of a busy road. 2) the conversion from a shop is rudimentary, eg the walls are very thin, and you can expect noise from neighboring guests (i think there are about 6 or 8 rooms), and plumbing noises. 3) most rooms do not have windows, but instead a skylight, 4) the skylight is a significant source of light at night, if you are sensitive to that, you can switch off the some of the hall lights which helps. 4) the beds (like much of singapore) are on the firm side. I liked it but my partner not so much. 5) the in-room shower while unconventional we found super nice, in the singapore heat we could freshen up several times each day. 6) the aircon is a powerful unit, and we found it quite chilly. After some trial and error by using the ""economode"" and set to 26 degrees, worked better. There is an airfreshener smell from the unit which we'd prefer without.  7) the common WCs share a space with the common kitchen, which is just weird. But we didnt use the kitchen, as theres so many good eateries around the neighborhood. For indian,  try Komala Vilas in Serangoon Rd for A/C sit down, or Maju65 on Perak Rd for street food.  Both friendly, tasty and authentic.  Remember, Singapore is crazy muggy right now. Don't plan on walking far during the day, or lugging suitcases any distance. Hit the Marina Gardens or Sentosa in the evening, thats what the locals do."
"The room was basic but quite ok. Unfortunately during my whole visit (3 days) water dripped from the ceiling onto the table, which flooded my all documents and other things."
"Good room temperature_ air conditioning is great after a whole day of exploring the city. clean, functional spaces

The place is very easy to find and is very near to Little India MRT station"
Good value for money place close to the Little India suburb in Singapore
Great location and conveniently close to the metro/bus station. Also has good dining options.
Great location in CBD. A convenient place to go most of the tourist attractions. Great stay.
"Check in was easy. Clean and neat room, and great to have your own shower and sink. Kitchen facilities provide all that is needed. Just be aware that sound travels a bit easy between the rooms. All said, its good value for money."
"Lokasi penginapan sangat mudah dicari, dekat dengan mrt, bus, dan beberapa tempat yang populer di singapore. Respon tuan rumah cepat namun respon pembantu agak lambat."

"We had a great stay. Place was clean, location was nice, check in was easy, strategic location, just as pictured. Anabel is always there to help us with anything. Thanks Diane!"
Great value for the money! Walking distance for the main attractions and own room with shower. Common toilets and kitchen. Everything was in ok condition.
The room was just right for a quick layover! Annabel and Diane were accommodating hosts!
The place is very convenient for getting around. Close to MRT station. The bed we stayed in (room 2) was a bit hard and the bathrooms are shared at the end of the hall. All in all worth the price!
Everything was great. Easy communication with all the details. Since our room was ready we could also check in early.
"Great room very well located.
Silent air conditioner, clean room.
Next to Little India!"

The room and shared spaces were really clean and we appreciated the free tea and coffee and using the washing machine! The shower was hot but the only downside was that the room sometimes got a little wet after showering. Overall, great value and would definitely stay here again!"
"As advertised. Dorm style, easy in easy out."
Nice place to stay defiantly will come back
"If there is tv or ipad attached in the room will be good for entertainments. Also, better to have toothbrush around as well. Otherwise all is good to go :) Comfortable & nice place to stay in!!"

"It was a great stay,
We enjoyed it so much"
"If you like a quiet neighborhood, this is the exact place you have to book. Communicative host, clean place, spacey enough and stylish. Would definitely go back some other time."
An extremely clean apartment in a great area. If I had any questions the host was always very quick to respond and nothing was too much trouble. Would definitely recommend.

Thanks for the great communication and hospitality. Highly recommended!
"Worst Airbnb experience. 
First, we could not get into the building upon arrival. This despite repeated assurances to the contrary. Calling the host also turned out to be a lost cause as the phone number listed was not in service. 
So after 17 hours of  flights and airports, my disabled mother had to just wait on the street for someone to show up so that we could sneak in behind them into the building. Beyond embarrassing!
When we finally got into the apartment, all the towels were hanging in the balcony, still wet. 
The kitchen and living area were infested with ants. 
The host response to all of the above: no comment on our difficulties getting into the place, sending a new set of towels 2 days later, and informing me that ants don__ bite so I should not worry about them....
I will just leave this here."
A wonderful place in a great location. Sunny is super quick to respond to any queries and was very helpful throughout our stay.
"Excellent location, amenities & transport close by. The pool was nice way to cool off after a long hot day There was a great shortcut using stairs which was across the road from the apartment. Great place to visit, walking distance  to Orchard Rd and the famous Raffles Hotel., if one is keen on walking."
"Good apartment, reccomment for next trip."
"Place is nice and clean to stay, not too far from downtown"
"Great location, lovely view from the balcony and loved the air con!"
A good place to stay. Quiet environment. Clean place.

"This is the perfect place to stay in Singapore if you__e only there for a short amount of time and want to see as much as possible. The location is fantastic, we saw so much in only 3 days! It__ right next to the metro! Communication with the host was absolutely excellent and the room was perfect. The bed is a little small for 2 people but it__ okay! Shower is fantastic!!! The room is part of a house but it has its own separate door so the space is completely private. Could not recommend this place enough. If you__e thinking of staying here- do it!! You won__ regret it."
Amazing location in a nice building. Beautiful pool. Super easy to get to from the airport via MRT.
"The place is absolutely amazing. Good value for money, close to MRT and multiple buses, multiple dining option within a walking distance.
Mak has been an amazing host and helped us a lot with all the questions and requests we had.
I really recommend this place."
Common area and swimming poor were stunning. Bathroom had some trouble and sound proofing was not good.
"Great host, lovely place, excellent pool and location! Hope to be back some day."
"We had a nice stay, thank you so much for the extra help to get our wallet back from the taxi! Really appreciate it! Come visit us some time!"
"Location is super convenient, minutes walk to MRT, buses downstairs. Several 7-11s and supermarkets downstairs, lots of great restaurants to choose from! Also minutes away from Clarke Quay. We had a comfy stay!"
"We are glad that found this place to stay for our trip to Singapore. It__ stylish decorated, super clean, with very convenient location. We had a comfortable stay, hope to visit again!"
"Great place! Nice location, good neighborhood, we enjoyed our stay here."
"- Fast response.
- Superb location.
- Clean bathrooms & bedrooms.
- Clean pillows, sheets, towels.

- the condition of the unit is so different from the one shown in the pictures. the unit is filled with the owner's stuff and very messy. I was staying with my family (8 of us) and I had to sleep on a bed in the living room. There was practically no ""living space"" because the room is full of the owner's stuff (computers, gadgets, stacks and stacks and stacks of empty cardboard boxes, shoes, clothes, suitcases, and many other things) all of them arranged very untidily. We had to rearrange the room in order to have some proper living space.

- the front door lock is nonexistent. The owner gave us keys, but when we tried to lock the door, it couldn't work, and after we checked, there were no bolts to actually lock the door. This raises questions on the security of the unit. We contacted the host about this, but he merely said ""he will check on it"" (he didn't check on it at all during the length of our stay)"
Good location and thank you
Good
"Brandon is super attentive to his guest's needs. Not located central to the city but it's close to MTR and a lot of direct buses. Plus it was great to experience a real local area with cheap good foods. Apartment is old so don't expect a brand new nice facilities but there was no hygiene issue. Overall, I would recommend here if you are looking for a good value for money accommodation."
"Brandon is a great host, and a very nice person. The room is exactly as he described and I would thoroughly recommend anyone trying to find affordable accommodation in Singapore."
Super detailed and attentive host. Room is decent. Cheaper and cheaper than a backpacker loft that's for sure.
Friendly and helpful host.
Thank you!
"Brandon is very warm-hearted. He provided a lot of help for me in my first day in Singapore. Also, his place is very clean, and others who live in his house are very polite. It's a very pleasant journey staying here. Highly recommended."
"I'm very happy to stay at your place, I feel the place is clean n well. That is good and cheap."
"This could be the most convenient place to stay when you are in Singapore, especially when you are in a simple work trip and hope to access transport and food within a very near distance. Looking for Brandon's place is hassle-free as the given guides and instructions are flawlessly clear. Home cleanliness is well managed by Brandon."
"I stayed at Brandon__ place for almost half a year and it was a very happy, pleasant and memorable experience for me. Considering that this is my first ever trip abroad, I was blessed to find Brandon__ place on Airbnb and meet such good-hearted people as my hosts. The place is very quiet, calm and peaceful; sometimes you can even get the feeling as if you live there all by yourself. Brandon is extremely considerate towards his guests and is open to any complaints from their side. Besides, if you have any question concerning Singapore or the slightest doubt on how to get around, you can always ask Brandon as he is extremely knowledgeable about the place and has valuable insights being a local Singaporean. The MRT stations, bus stops, eating places, laundromat, supermarkets and other shops are very near and within walking distance. You can find all sorts of nice and affordable local food here - you will be spoiled for choice. Most importantly, Brandon is very careful in his vetting and selection of his guests. All of them are very quiet, clean, friendly, polite and considerate people. You can be ensured of your safety and personal space while staying here. I would totally stay at this place again and I highly recommend it!"
he is so kind that he tell you about all tourist informationyou need. Nice place and near mrt station

"Located in a quaint part of Singapore. Comfortably near to food places, malls, transport options and if planning to go to JB, very convenient too. All amenities are met, simple but with comforts of home. If you want peace and quiet yet still arms length from community activities, then this is the place. Did i mention cost of living more affordable than in city centre? Singapore experience at a more affordable cost."
"Kleines, sauberes Zimmer, mit allem was man braucht. Sehr ausfÃ¼hrliche Einweisung vom Gastgeber, sowohl vorab Ã¼ber Messenger, wie spÃ¤ter in der Wohnung. Etwas au_erhalb, aber gute Ã¶ffentliche Verkehrsanbindung. Kleine Restaurants in unmittelbarer Umgebung."
"Clean ,quiet place with ample of nearby amenities and food outlets"
"Super affordable place that's in a very residential part of Singapore. The host is very good with communicating with your any needs. Good and safe area, especially for solo travelers out there!"
It's a convenient place and a friendly house owner.
"Brandon is a super kind and attentive host! The location was great with plenty of affordable local food options within walking distance. It was a quiet and peaceful place, great for affordable long term stay! I would definitely recommend :)"
"Well, everything quite good except for the distance quite far from city but it does__ matter because it quite near the bus stop and mrt station. Their are variety kinds of food near the place quite cheap and yummy."
"Given the price, the standard was ok.
Brandon explains everything in great detail and gives a lot of valuable advice about the city.
The room itself was clean.

The only thing that for me definitely needs to be changed / renovated is the bathroom. Considering the fact that everyone needs to walk barefoot (which is fine when everything is super clean), walking in the bathroom where I saw a lot of hair and some insects in the draining was disgusting. Moreover everything, including toilet seat was wet because the shower is without any glass walls or doors. I know there are a few people in a flat, but definitely someone should take care more of bathroom__ cleanness. If I saw the bathroom__ pictures before, I wouldn__ book this room."
A nice and quite neighbourhood good for a peacefull rest. However the room did not have an AC so it was really hot and nearly impossible to sleep.
"I would like to recommend Brandon__ place because he offers a clean, calm and quiet space for a pleasant stay. Meanwhile, his friendly approach will make us feel secure for one who__ having a solo trip. Thanks to Brandon once again for offering me a wonderful stay in Singapore."
Clean and quiet place. Perfect for vacation. The ambience is cozy and relaxing.
"Cozy, clean, comfortable and convenient. Great place to stay and the host is very friendly."
"They house is clean and also very accessible to bus station, restaurants and MRT station.

The host  responded quickly to our inquiries very accommodating and friendly host."
"Alee's room was spacious and clean and the stay was comfortable only until she arrives. She started posing unstated rules. She even accused us for some mess in the bathroom which we didn't create. We felt like living in some super restricted place or some kind of spacious prison. We told her that we will check out early at 8 due to our flight timings but later got some emergencies and we got delayed with the check out by one hour, still 2 hours before the check out time. She started knocking and got restless and furious, sat outside on the stairs, repeatedly knocking and shouting. She told us that she had agreed to some other guest for early check-in but when I checked in Airbnb, that room was available to book for next whole month. Clearly she was lying. Her husband, though available on (Hidden by Airbnb) only was quite supportive and nice. Also in terms of location, the place is (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) muns walking from metro station and 10 mins walking from bus stop, which is opposite to the information she has given.
Overall her place was nice and upto the mark but the host wasn't."
good.
"The place is good and spacey. they have toiletries, towels, kettle, hair dryer, big TV, shower heater, air-condition, ceiling fan and has kitchen too."
Alee & Johnny's place is really comfortable and the room is bigger than we expected! Checking in and out are pretty smooth with clear instructions given even though the hosts couldn't personally meet us. They are really hospitable & responsive to all our queries.  Overall its good value for the money. Will definitely come back.
"Good and spacious rooms, pleasant and quiet atmosphere, close to public transport. Ideal."
"Excellent choice we made to stay at Alee's house! The place is well taken care of, our 1 bedroom appartement was sparkling clean and had absolutely everything one might need including iron, ironing board, hair dryer, lots of storage space for clothes and belonging... And the list goes on! Alee and her husband were very welcoming and eagerly accommodated to our travelling plans, letting us drop off luggage as we checked in early and checked out late. The location is convinient to explore the city with many public transports available within a short walk distance... We definitely recommend this place!"
"Clean place, close to the tube station. Easy check in. You can also leave your bags throughout the day if your flights is late."
Nice place to stay.
"Our room is really clean and the lady that cleans the house is very nice. No problem with checking in and out. Everything went smoothly. MRT is a bit far but if you know how to use the bus, it would be easier. Will surely book this place again."
"Location is perfect, just few minutes to walk Eunos MRT."

"Alee and Johnny had been very welcoming throughout the stay! The place is clean, comfy and most importantly near to MRT station! Will definitely stay here the next time we visit Singapore!"
"I had a pleasant stay in Alee's room in Singapore. It's clean and has everything you might need for a short stay. The communication with host was also very good, Alee or her husband replied very quickly to all my messages. There are a lot of cheap places to eat in near the house, definitely worth checking out. MRT station is also close, making all the interesting spots accessible.

I think Alee's room is a great place to stay in, especially for this relatively small price."
"There were mosquitoes in the room. When we mentioned about the stench in the bathroom, Alee shouted at us and accused us of causing it.

She literally took over the room as soon as it was check out time, even though we were ready to check out.

They provide washing machine but not the liquid. So the washing machine was quite useless.

Flow of water in the washbasins was so slow that it was not possible to wash your hand without touching the basin. They seem to have slowed down the flow on purpose.

Water from the shower leaks into the rest of the bathroom and you are expected to mop it."
"Alee's place is amazingly close to bus stations, and can fit several people (with a fee). You only need to walk a bit to reach a great Foodcourt and restaurants. Super close to a 7-11. It's also pretty comfortable and has enough air conditioner to help you survive the humid Singaporean air!"
Cozy place
"PROS:
-Good price-performance
- Fast answers
- Good Location (Close to MRT & Center),  nearby supermarket
- Enough Space
-Easy Check-In/Out
- Washing Mashine

CONS:
- Bathroom a bit dirty, not like on the pictures 
- No pressure water tap
- Host went into our room without asking, when we were away"
"good location, clean, comfy"
It was clean and the owner is fast in attending to my issue.

"The house is located in a quiet neighborhood so it's a good place to rest at after touring several attractions in Singapore (which usually requires long walks to visit). The house is very clean and with a comfortable living room sofa and comfortable beds. The AC units worked well. On the other hand, the ceiling fan may need fixing.

The hosts were very accommodating and attended to our requests as much as they could, without having to constantly see us personally. Communication was mostly done through (Hidden by Airbnb) which was easy to use.

The hosts also provided recommendations for attractions that we could visit. They were also very reassuring and made us feel welcome despite the COVID-19 scare.

Overall, this is a great place to stay for a short visit to Singapore. The price may be a bit high, but I won't hesitate to book this again when I come back to Singapore."
Located near to (Website hidden by Airbnb) stops are near by and there are lots of restaurants nearby
Great
"Alee hospitality was great  , The room was clean & spacious ,
There are 2 shared bathroom toilet ,kitchen and washing machine too if you need to do laundry , Highly recommend"

A friendly host and comfortable place to stay.
Sparkling clean room with amazing view (high floor!). Hotel-like bathroom. Overall a great place to stay.
"Great place, in a new and fancy apartment with various facilities. Friendly host. Close to the MRT and bus station, 24hour 7-11 in 5 minutes walk."
My stay here was great. The host is super nice. I would recommend staying here if you're in the area.
"This place is very conveniently located a 5 min. walk away from Lakeside MRT station and also close to local food and shopping areas just across Jurong West Street 41. The windows face away from the train tracks, and the place is very quiet in general. The bed and the pillow were comfortable, air conditioning nice and quiet. The thick curtains did a good job of blocking the light from the moon or buildings across the street.
The apartment is located in a recenly finished condominium, so everything is new and built to a high standard. The bathroom is right across the corridor from the room and has a washbasin, a toilet and a shower. The Wifi is quite fast and the signal is strong.
The host is very friendly, though we didn't see each other much (as a business traveller, I would spent most of the day outside). The check-in process was straightforward. Leisure-minded travellers will appreciate the condominium's facilities, such as the gym and swimming pool.
All in all, I can wholeheartedly recommend this place to business travellers and those tourists who don't mind staying a bit further away from the city centre, but still very near to the MRT and the real Singapore ""heartlands"" where local residents live their daily lives."

"Very peaceful, quiet and superb place to stay. Beautiful neighborhood and would definitely book again for the next business trip.

 10 - 15 minutes walk to Cashew Station and St. Joseph Church (Bukit Timah)."
Comfortable stay!! Recommend to everyone
I felt more immersed in the wider-scope of Singaporean culture in that things on the west side were more accessible to me because of where I stayed. And of course you're a quick walk away from a train station if you want to go Downtown. This was way better than staying in a hotel for me.

Great hospitality. Thanks Tricia.
Place was great and everything was great for 3 adults and 3 kids
"Location was new Hawker Centre and 24/7 grocery store. The underground was also near by, so you can get around easily. Was very comfortable and happy staying at Ec__ place!"
EC is a nice person to deal with and most importantly that he's responsive. He's transparent and everything was as mentioned on airbnb and as per the emails and guidelines sent.
"Ec__ place is very accessible, clean and very quiet . You wont worry about your belongings because it is so safe.   No one can enter the premises unless you are not the renter :) two locked doors before your room.  We always come home late like 12 in the midnight and we just walk the street from DAKOTA station.  Theres food restaurant near just 100 meters away.  It was very conventient from all access."
Generally convenient location at geylang area but not much food choices available in the morning. living condition is ok for the price range if you are not too picky.

highly recommended
"A great place, very well located, and the owner responds very fast."
Good stay
This apartment is nice... very convenient.... location is super and the host is so nice! Close to the airport...
"The place is nice, convenient. There is also a lots of stall or super market nearby(within 5min walk). However, when there's other people came and live next to you, you won't get a good sleep as it is very noisy. I stay there for 5day and 2 of it aren't having a good sleep"
Excellent communication and very smooth check in!
"Good place to stay, near to Bus and MRT. Stay could have been better if the room and toilet both were throughly cleaned. Aircon was amazing, door had a lock and checkin was perfectly organised."
"Convenient location, easy check-in and spacious bedroom. Cannot complain about anything, especially for the price point _ºï_ will stay there again"
This place is easy to find. Fit for 2 people. The room and the private bathroom are clean. Small cozy kitchen.
Comfy environment

"Very spacious place,the bathroom and the room is big and it is not so far from the bus stop and the MRT. The mrt is just about 10 minutes walk away at dakota station."
"Great place to stay in, no complaints! We had the Level 2 Room 4. My bf is a super light sleeper so I was concerned about noise. Despite the building being right by the main road, we experienced no traffic noises. Maybe because of the location of the room 4 was at the back of the building? There were other rooms closer to the road so I can't comment on that. Room 4 was also close to the mosque where there were some events going on and they were speaking through a speaker, but if you close the windows, the sounds will be barely noticeable. Overall a good place to stay for short term rental. Shared amenities were also complete, although we didn't use them much."
"Location was very convenient, and host was very friendly and reachable. I urge future tenant to let the host know if you have any problem or questions because he__ very helpful."
"Worth it. Penginapan dengan harga murah, dekat dengan mrt dan halte. Kamar luas dan bersih, fasilitas lumayan lengkap seperti setrika,hair dryer, namun sayangnya tidak tersedia sabun dan shampo. Tapi semuanya sudah bagus untuk harga segitu"
"We had a great  stay at ECs place. Check in was very smooth and the place had good amenities. The location is very good, peaceful and well connected with public transport. It would be a pleasure to stay here in future too."
"Great place for the price in a good location. In all, pretty good place to stay if won__ be in the room except for night."

Easy check-in/check-out + great communication with host. Great budget option with a convenient location.
Nice place to stay
excellent! Service is worth the price..clean rest room
"Location was good, near little India station exit A
Cleanliness must be improved 
The room for 4 people was to small
It's very noisy during the Night, many people talk at the streets beside G4 station"
"Host: Fast response, polite, nice
Room: spacious, clean, good location
Thanks for hosting me and this place is highly recommended!"
"Nice place , friendly host , clean, nearby foodcourt & amenities. 
Would highly recommend this place for other people.."
Very friendly host. Clean environment. Very convenient for food and transportation.
Worth for money. Very hygienic and sparkling clean.
"Is very convenient to go to Yishun MRT, Interchange Bus and Northpoint."
Near Yishun Mrt and NorthPoint Center room is comfortable and clean
Nice place. Near almost to everything
Quite a nice place
Place was clean and peaceful but a bit far from the MRT station.
"Great place, near MRT, shopping mall, wallet friendly price!"
"Generally the stay was okay. The problem is with the checking out. I left the access cards on the table in the living room before leaving like everyone would, and notified the host about my doing so. However, only more than 24h later that the host told me that she couldn't find the access cards and demanded payment. When I asked about why she tell me so late, she conveniently told me she was oversea, despite telling me that she was at work before that (I previously asked why she wasn't available at the time of checking out). Something is not right there, could be a scam or she really couldn't find it.  Stay here if you want, but be sure to give her the keys in person to avoid bull crap like this."
doing good
"As shown in the photo, cosy and clean room"
"All in all great place to stay, convenient and affordable"
Apartment is clean and well-kept and good location.
I hope they can add additional picture of the house or bedroom. And location is not ideal if you are in a budget and would like to visit Singapore's attractions.
Check the distance from where are you located and if you need a double bed room then first confirm on this part.
Very professional and cordial.  Fair and honest
nice place to stay
quite nice
It's a nice quiet space! Nobody would disturb you! I enjoyed the privacy that was there!
"Good place to stay at affordable price. Bed bit small, but can accomodate a couple but dint expect a spacious bed . Overall an amazing host and great stay"
Place is once again to my expectations for the price point! Barely see anyone around the house so if you like your privacy it is a good place to book!
"Thanks Huiqing for accomadating my very last minute request to book. Your place is super nice, super clean and you're super patient with my never ending queries.  I'll book again in the near future i hope. Thanks again ya :)"
The room is cosy and private. The host is nice and very responsive.
Cosy suite
"Close to a supermarket for any light marketing, close to the MRT as well. Very peaceful place, great for a short stay. Highly recommend."
"The location is perfect , a lot of food nearby the condo. Food is nice and cheap"
"Location was quite convenient, walkable distance to Fort Canning/Clarke Quay. Room was clean and tidy, with good in-room entertainment. Only gripe is that I had to wait quite a while before I was shown to my room. Overall, good experience!"
Note that if you are on level 5 that lift only goes to level 3 if it works at all. Access  via very steep narrow staircase . A 2 night stay had no lift working.
"Great little place to stay, a 10-15mins slight upslope walk should be expected from the two nearby MRT stations."
"Great place to stay in Central Singapore, easy car ride from all the main attractions and 6/8 mins walk to MRT (Metro). Nice clean apartments, they should just provide better newer towels."
Rc's place was a great one. I love the location; it's easy to find and within walking distance from Fort Canning MRT Station. He's swift in responding to my messages. I like how neat and clean the room was.
"Die Unterkunft an sich ist in Ordnung. Im Prinzip ist es genauso wie auf den Bildern. Die Lage ist super und man hat einen guten Startpunkt, um die Stadt zu erkunden. Zum Marina Bay sind es fu_lÃ¤ufig ca. 25 min! Die Kommunikation war schnell und reibungslos. Die AC ist einmal ausgefallen und es kam sofort Hilfe!! 
Was mir nicht gut gefallen hat, war, dass die Unterkunft doch sehr klein ist. Das wirkt auf den Bildern ein wenig gro_zÃ¼giger.. man kommt am Bett kaum zur TÃ¼r vorbei! Was auch schwierig war sind die Lichter (vor allem die zahlreichen hellen Lichter am Router) und die diversen GerÃ¤usche (irgendwas knackst immer). Also wer einen leichten Schlaf hat ..  schwierig! Die AC im Raum ist zwingend notwendig!! Leider ist die kleine KÃ¼che immer sehr sehr warm!"
It met our requirement for 4 week stay at Singapore.   Wish the double bed can be changed to a single bed to create more space.    Thank you Joey.
Wonderful place and guest - definitely recommend

Good
Nomad is a great host and extremely helpful and communicative. Spotless place with amenities as expected.
"Nomad__ place is much more than I can describe with my words. I should admit staying his place was literally the best airbnb experience so far, five stars for everything is definitely not enough. Very friendly and professional host, will miss the times staying here for long. My only worry is if I would not be able to satisfy myself to stay elsewhere airbnbing, mind blowingly increased my standard way too high. Wish all host and rooms should be like this gentleman and this place. Thanks a million again!"
"Very wormhearted and easy-going host! Tidy, clean and airing room! Definitely recommended for the short stay!"
"Thanks Nomad for hosting a great and convenient place to stay.  Great host to be with, very friendly and helpful. The location makes staying over at the place absolutely convenient to get to different places."

Best stay ever!! Thank you James !!
A good clean place and James made me feel well looked after. Couldn__ have asked for more really
"Great room and ensuite in a good location. Very comfortable with everything you would need. James is very helpful with checking in, as well as tips for what to do locally. I would stay here another time if I come to Singapore again!"
It was a pleasure to met james. He picked me up at the mrt station and showed me the way to the appartement. It is very near to the mrt station. When i asked hin something in msg he replay very fast. He gave me water for free. If i go again to singapore i would ever rent this appartment. thx james for everything. Take care. Greet david
"Thank you James for being such a lovely host! The room was super clean and in a convenient yet quiet area, which was perfect considering I was in Singapore for work. I would stay at James' place in Singapore again regardless of work or personal travel."
"Great place to stay, wonderful host, welcomed me upon arrival and was very quick to respond to any queries I had. Highly recommended."
"Pick up war Perfekt, die Lage Mega gut . James hat mich selber abgeholt .Alles Mega nah oder im GebÃ¤ude . 4 min Zum hooker center , Chinatown 10 min zu fuss . Metro 4 Minuten wenn der Fahrstuhl nicht da ist .lage einfach geil"
"Great place, very central.  Precisely what I needed for a business trip - clean, well prepared, responsive.  Made me feel very welcome."
Quite convenient place near the station.  The host was so responsive
The host canceled this reservation 45 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
Small but very clean and perfectly located apartment with a great and welcoming host. Pool and a lot of shops and eating (even 24/7) very close by. Great little kitchen area and washing machine was helpful as we were backpacking.  I would highly recommend staying here both alone and as a couple.
Great hospitality. Great location.
Great place and location spent a few months here and would definitely recommend.
Overall staying at Capsule Hostel with my friends as a impromptu stayca was not bad. The overall ambience was okai actually just lack of lift but it was fine ~ there__ pantry for drinks and breakfast but didn__ manage to try it. The rooms was fine same goes with the toilet and small living room for all 6 of us. Just that the wall is abit dirty with colourings... I would recommend to people who just want to stay for a night or two but if it__ a longer stay maybe can consider others..  I feel the staff at the counter ain__ as friendly but the location is really near CQ mrt and Raffles mrt which is good just that address not specific enough as along that street there__ other hostel too. It would help a lot of they respond more often on the messages as I texted them twice and no respond at all.
"The place is really with in the center of everything. Near the clubs and coffee shops. The nearest mrt is clarke quay. The suite room is at the top most and has a spaceous area. The toilet is big.only down side is the staff doesnt know how to operate the tv and nobody told us about trash disposal so like for 3days our garbage got piled up. 


Over all the place is so accessible."
A great location and facilities. Best value for money.
"We were a group on 4 travelers, husband and wife plus two friends. The 3 bedrooms were fine for us. Each bedroom plus the common room had an aircon. This was perfect!  The location was perfect, too. Near an MRT station, near many restaurants, near the riverwalk, near lots of shopping, near many attractions. Very walkable and clean."
"Amazing location, everything you need"
"Paid for this room and then proceeded to location, call staff and they say that the boss is using room and cannot accept my booking. Say that they cant cancel it and ask me to do it on my own. Next day i tried calling again and staff was rude"
"Location is good. Other than that we did not enjoy this ""hotel"" at all. Street facing rooms have single pane windows so all the noise from China Town will leak into your room. We could barely sleep. Unbearable noise from the street and also from the internal bar. The room was super tiny for two people. Little room for luggage. We had to walk over the bed all the time. The shower and bathroom are poorly designed. If you take a shower the whole place will get flooded. Good luck getting the room cleaned. We had to ask the front desk for clean towels because they didn't clean the room ever. The place is also under construction so the common areas will be dusty and disgusting. The escalator should be under quarantine."
excellent host. compact and decent place :)
"Hepful host. Can give lot of tips for local food, attractions and transport."
"Place was good and economical, 15 mins walk from Commonwealth MRT"
I would recommend to stay with them. The couple is an amazing host. Very adjusting and warm. I had a comfortable stay with them. The location is also great as it's only walking distance from mrt and bus stops. Even shopping complex for daily needs and eateries.
Everything was perfect as I expected. I recommend traveler to stay there for short and long stay. Thanks a lot for Nikhil and his family.

I arrived Singapore at 7:30 AM and the check in is at 14:00 PM, but J made sure to not only picked me up from the train station but to give me early check in at 11 Am since his guest left earlier.

The location is perfect for me, it__ close to train station( Just 1 minutes walk to MRT station and 2 stops away from the airport)._If you get a tourist pass for three days it__ definitely worth it.

Highly recommend J's place to everyone."
Value for money. Quite beautiful than pictures. Love this place.
"Considering we were steps away from a train station, it was remarkably quiet! The wifi and housing complex amenities were excellent. We found the bed a little too firm for our liking but realize others prefer it that way. We highly recommend this accommodation."
Great place and nice host.
Great value for money
This apartment is very clean and comfortable Also very quiet in the evening . It__ about a 100 metres from the MRT so easy access to the city and / or the airport The grounds are lovely and there is a 50 metre pool with a shower etc. The nearest big supermarket is about 800 metres away and there are also eating places next to it : Thoroughly recommend this apartment especially if you want to be a bit out of the main city
Perfect location for a quick layover. Easy access to both the airport and downtown. The washing machine was great and lots of hangers and a rack on the deck to dry clothes. The shower and amenities were great as well. The space is very cozy but has everything you need for a stay and is comfortable. Good value with a nice gym and pool. No extra towels were provided for the pool

"This is a lovely condo complex with great facilities.  The apartment is a good size for 2 people with everything needed for a comfortable stay.  Nice touches like toothbrush sets and body wash available.  Balcony useful for drying clothes. Just a minute's walk from the MRT or buses with direct services to the airport and town.  J was a helpful host, quick respond to any questions."
Thank you J for being warm and friendly. He helped me with the bags the minute I reached his residence. I had almost a mth stay there. It was great. The whole apartment is looking bright and (Website hidden by Airbnb) is perfect for a single or a young family to stay.Will definitely come back again.Thanks J!

A good stay. Location wasn__ too hard to find. Friendly host. Overall good experience.
It__ a really lovely palace to stay! I will recommend if you come to Singapore and thanks Ailyn!
"The place was huge with everything available. However the shower toilet has a glass door! Hence if you were to shower and someone was in the bedroom, they can see everything. That was the only down side. Other than that, the room was great. Much bigger and expected and really clean. Everything was given, more than enough towels were given, extra blankets were also in the room. I couldnt find the hairdryer but it could be i didnt find hard enough. I wasnt sure."
Abit run down looking. Okay place to stay
Nice location to get away from the city. But the apartment not that clean as my expectation. Hope that the host will do something for it.
"a not bad place , near shopping malls and quite convenient"
"Good location, easy access to condo without any security requirements"
There was smoke cigarette smoke from the previous guest. I cleaned it up by opening all the windows and spraying air freshener febreeze. Otherwise the place is good and very comfortable. Thank you.
v clean and well kept place will come here again
Very nice place
Place was amazing and clean. A nice place for a weekend staycay
Great response and great place for 6.
"Really nice lady, fast check in and hassle free!"
Nancy is very responsive and is an excellent problem solver. Her place is great for mid-long term stays
Nancy__ place was clean simple and no fuss. I had a nice time there. It__ an interesting little house located in the midst of high rise condos and HDBs. There__ a market and food center located within walking distance if you are looking for local food. Be sure to go early as it closes in the afternoon. Would definitely book again~
"Enjoyed my stay, it's located conveniently for visiting the city."
Great location. Clean and spacious room. Value for money for sure! Highly reccommended.
"Le logement est bien situÃ©, au calme, et bÃ©nÃ©ficie d'une petite terrasse bien agrÃ©able. IdÃ©al pour se ressourcer aprÃ¨s le tumulte de la ville."
"Great host, great place. Recommended! Thanks Nancy!"
Great place. Nancy is very accommodating and friendly. Overall stay was very nice and comfortable.
"I stayed at Nancy__ place__ a couple of weeks ago for a few days in two of her apartments. 

The first stay was a few days in the one with the turtle pool and it was great having them as company as I was alone! :)

Nice location near Little India and Nancy is very pleasant great to speak to incase you need to and is always easy to contact. Also check in very easy and pleasant.

CP from UK"
"Clean, spacious and well resourced in an easily reachable but quiet location.

I enjoyed my stay here and Nancy was very prompt with answering communications and assisting with any issues that arose.

Definitely somewhere I would stay again if I were to re-visit Singapore."
"Clean space with your own kitchenette area. Laundry right outside the door, very convenient and self contained. Perfect place for solo traveler or a couple."
Nancy was an excellent and pleasant host. Very prompt responses and so warm!
Nancy is a very responsive host. She understands my needs and made everything for me upon my arrival. Thank you
Thank you
"Very nice space, super clean, fast wifi, location can't be beat, helpful host. Recommended"
"Had a seamless stay at St.Signature.  Definitely recommended, great location, and great value!"
"Great for the price. I__ recommend Fang__ place to any budget traveler who is going to be spending most of their time exploring the city. Comfortable bed, convenient location and a helpful staff!"
"Great location, in the middle of 2 MRT stations, which is less than 10mins walk away. There's a bus stop right outside the place. Instructions was very clear as to how to check-in and out even though I don't get to have anyone explained to me in person, response was very fast too if I have any questions.

Room was kinda small, but that was expected from the pic. It was still a very comfortable stay, would definitely recommend."
"Even though I was at the hotel at the time of lockdown, I didn't feel lke I'm unsafe sharing the amenities with other guests, thanks to all the measures taken for our safety and comfort ;)
I do recommend to pay a little bit extra and get a room with a window, I stayed 5 days in a room without a window, it was nice but got me a little depressed, well sunshine matters, then I moved to a room with window for another 5 days - great great experience!"
"Wonderful, clean, great location and hospitality."
"5__¥½è¯,å¾__"
Did not expect the place to look as great as it did. I was expecting an okay looking capsule living space but the place looked incredibly stylish and modern. Would definitely reccomend this place. What a pleasant surprise to my trip.
Outstanding and great choice to stag at a very reasonable price
"Great place, much better than I expected. More importantly, excellent location. If you__e in Singapore to eat and drink, this is pretty much a perfect place for you."
"This was a perfect location for my solo, 5 day trip to Singapore. It is a couple minute walk from two MRT stations and across the street from Chinatown. Great value considering how incredibly clean it is.  The beds are very comfortable and getting into the bunk made me feel like I was a teenager again!  The room's may appear small, and they are, but all the more reason to spend time in the beautiful city. When you finally get back, and maybe after a few Tigers, you will be very happy to be here."
"Great staff and nice place. The photos equal 100% the real room. The Hotel is located in Chinatown very easy to get around, also the check-in and check-out was great and easy. Almost everything was super clean. You will enjoy the stay at Fangs Hotel ;)"
"A lovely place in a prime location at Chinatown - great as a base to explore the surroundings on foot. Would recommend taking Grab down as it's a walk from the nearest station especially with luggage. Plenty of food all around, you'll be spoilt for choice. For ladies, it would be good if you can request for the rooms to be on Level 3 and 4 as the female/mixed toilets are on the same level unless you're okay with the slight inconvenience. Nonetheless, it was still an enjoyable stay for a 3D2N solo staycation and the bed is very comfy. Three cheers for free Netflix :)"
"This place is wonderful! It__ worth every $. The hotel located in the heart of China town. Th metro 5 minutes away. Restaurant, local shops, and bars are within steps of this hotel. The hotel staff were fantastic; they helped me check in, find good places to eat and hangout. I definitely recommend staying in this place. It is much better than I expected. I was very happy with my stay."
Very clean and great location. Amazing pillows and bedding
"For starters, I__ an older, overweight American.  I wanted to stay local, meet folks, experience the area. This place scores on all fronts.  The only thing lacking was an elevator, but they tell you that upfront and I could use the exercise.  The location is fabulous, MRT is close by, a foodie paradise across the street, and a very helpful and friendly staff that offers tips along the way. The place was very clean and safe. I__ stay there again in a heartbeat."
"A very cozy and clean place located right at the heart of Singapore just walking distance from Chinatown MRT, thereby making it the perfect launch pad for exploring the entire city. It fits right into the budget for the convenience it offers to the guests. Just across the street you get authentic Singaporean breakfast. There are plenty of shopping options around catering to both the broke backpacker and to the ones with a fat wallet. Major attractions which can be explored on foot include the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Sri Mariamman Temple and China Heritage Center. Fang is an amazing host. She was very polite, warm & cheerful and offered me some excellent local tips which made my trip much more convenient. Thanks and I hope to come back here again!"
Nice and clean hotel and staffs
Great place to stay!
"It's an amazing and beautiful place for staying a few days in Singapore: great location, super clean and great host!"
"good, but required additional deposit when check in...not sure this is allowed in airbnb but they doesnt have any offline cc machine nor accept any cash for the deposit, which mean if you are using oversea credit card, you may need to change your sim card and sms to make the deposit via cc online...which is troublesome for me"
"Location was great with many street food stalls and Maxwell food centre nearby. MRT within walking distance and public bus stop just outside hotel entrance.
Place was very clean and new."
"Great value for money. Brand new place, very modern. Though don__ expect much from sound isolation:)"
Great place
"Really impressed with the air bnb. Location was excellent, the communal areas (incl. toilets and showers) were extremely stylist, nice to be in and also very clean. The bed was so comfy and the little room was perfect for a great night sleep. Exceeded expectations. Only down point was there was a little trouble with the virtual login and I was charges twice for the deposit. I have been reassured that the refund will come through in a few days...."
The place is brand new and sparkling clean.  Great location!
Good place to stay
Perfect place to stay in Singapore just in front of Chinatown. The room is very comfy and everything is clean. You can also cook if you want. Staff members are very kind and will help you if you need something.

"The place was new and very clean. I checked in 20 minutes early, so had to wait a little for my room to be ready, but in the meantime I had a free cup of coffee in the kitchen area while using the WiFi. My room was clean, and the toilet and bathing facilities were too. 
Nothing but good points to make about this place. Will be using it again next time I go to Singapore."
"Decent, simple, lovely experience.
Love the fact that everything is clean and neat.

For first timers, do read the instructions properly to ensure smooth processing of your stay."
"Just what I needed. It's in a good location in Chinatown. Close to 7-Eleven where you can get a SIM card for 10 bucks with a data of 100GB, a EZ-link card if you wish to ride the bus or the train for cheap, close to the taxi stand and everything."
"Had an amazing and restful stay during my 24 hour layover in Singapore. Fang__ place is really conveniently located near the Chinatown hawker center, the MRT, and many cute shops. A very walkable, accessible and safe area. The hotel was very clean, and the bathrooms even had hair dryers with diffuser attachments (which is great for anyone with curly hair)! Loved the shared spaces, especially the rooftop with the hammock. Great stay overall"
"Excellent location. Easy communication. Good facilities. Overall, great stay."

I had a great stay!"
"Great, just as described, thanks!"
Good value for money
"I visited Singapore on a solo adventure for five days and found ST Signature to be exactly what I needed in terms of the location and accommodation.

I stayed in a  single room with a high bed, which was pretty fun to climb up to. The room is narrow, but there is a desk, tv screen, and mirror dresser and safe. I was out exploring the city and stuffing my face at hawker centers most of the day and only used the room for sleeping.

I wasn__ sure about the communal bathrooms when I booked, but I didn__ have any issues with the shared space during my stay. They provide soap and shampoo.

The WiFi was reliable and consistent. The staff were AMAZING! I got in on a late flight, and they sent me a message when I landed asking when I would arrive and reminded me how to check in on the website. I also got tons of local recs and advice from them. The location is a quick walk from the MRT station, and there is a ton of food within a few minutes walk. I would definitely stay here again!"
"Accommodation was as advertised, but regret not paying a little more elsewhere for a private bathroom."

This place what's exactly what I needed. The space was very limited but it did the trick!

"Great stay, really enjoyed it. The place was very new and modern, loved the interior design. Toilets and showers were sparkling clean and I rarely ran into another guest in there. Air con worked well in the room, WiFi was OK (1 MB/s down).

I only stayed a few nights and housekeeping cleaned my room once already. I would prefer there be a way to tell housekeeping to skip my room since it was unnecessary for my case."

I had a pleasant stay. Everything was great. The only advice I would like to give is that try not to get a room near the hallway doors. I stayed in a room right next to one and I often woke up to people slamming it.

I love how forward-looking of its concept of self check-in. It was challenging at first but it made sense after. The rooms are clean and really smells fresh. The shared bathroom is beautiful. The location is very strategic. Its a beautiful hotel.

"This is really a wonderful hotel, quiet, clean with reasonable price. I am quite satisfied with it."
"Place is solid! A very central location, space is exactly for the basics. A great tech-hostel, everything is modern and you got TV/WiFi/AC and plenty of outlets. Bed is comfortable and the bathrooms are legitimately impressively clean the entire space is close to spotless. Would definitely recommend a 3-5 day space here. My only regret is not going for the bigger bed and I didn't meet as many people as I would have liked. But, it's close to the food market and nicely placed in Chinatown to walk to everything you need. Overall, well worth it."
"Clean and quiet place, good for privacy. Would definitely book again!"
Great location and quick and friendly host!
"I chose ST Signature second time as my place to stay in Singapore. For second time it was great choice. Online check in and out was easy and smooth (better than my first time, it was very improved). Thank you again! I highly reccomend this beautiful, clean and comfortable place in heart of Chinatown!"
Nice small cabins in the heart of downtown. Everything was super clean. I would plan to stay there for my next trip!
"It was very clean and welcoming place, perfectly located!"
"Clean, convenient, everything you need for a couple days in Singapore. If you__e looking just for a place to rest your head at night, I would recommend this place."
Stay at St Signature Chinatown is really a good stop to go around for a touristic or business trip around Singapore.
"Amazing place to stay, superb location. Nice and clean with great amenities. Communication and checkin was smooth and painless. 10/10 would recommend for anyone visiting Singapore."
Nice journey
"The location was amazing, especially being there on Chinese New Year. The space was really clean, and it was super easy to check in and out. This is a great place to stay if you__e planning on spending your time exploring Singapore and just need a place to sleep. There__ also a patio area if you want to simply work on your laptop, which was really nice to have access to. Thanks for a great stay!"
"Perfect for single travelers.  Dorm-style private space. Shared bathroom, but it was spotless. Very clean. Room was clean and quiet.  The location is fantastic. I will return."
Room is small for the price I feel. Aircon wasn't working well in my unit. Definitely wasn't 21c. Soap dispensers were not refilled in the common toilet for a few days.
"Everything was great! Awesome location, easy communication, super clean and will definitely come back."
Very comfortable and in a great location! Highly recommend for solo travelers not wanting to break their budget. Would stay again.
"Stayed here for two nights and it was so comfortable, especially compared to my last Airbnb. The room is definitely cozy, but I expected that so had no issues. Both the room and the shared bathroom were sparkling clean (the bathroom even has a waterfall showerhead), and the bed and bedding were both very comfortable. Super central location, right at the entrance to the Chinatown walking street.I did have a glitch with the lock but the virtual assistant helped me resolve quickly. Would stay here again!"
The room was really cream and organized. Also security was perfect. I could enjoy my trip. Next time I will use here.
"This place looks like a small version of a luxury hotel room. Clean, elegant and comfortable. The room is small of course for the affordable price."
sympa!

"Nice shared hotel, sad that during phase 2 cannot use public facilities."
"Great location and excellent coffee machine with helpful and friendly staff.  I liked my stay enough to extend my stay an additional day.   I'm a very light sleeper and wake at the slightest noise, but my fellow guests were not noisy.   Shower pressure hot water were excellent (I used the 2nd floor mens room not the 4th floor unisex bathroom)"
"At the beggining I had  problems with self online check in, some error of the system occured, but  after few minutes via online chat with host everything was fixed. The place is amazing with superb interior design and the best location you can have. It's in heart of Chinatown so everything what you want to see or buy is near by. Room was perfect with very comfortabe bed. Everything looks like on pictures and even better. My special thanks are to the hosts who were super kind and helpful and I could count on them whenever I needed. If I would come back to Singapour propably I would choose the same place to stay. Also one additional thing: pictures at the entrance are amazing, really beautiful documentary story! Thanks for hosting me!"

"The place is very clean, one though a bit small. The shared bathrooms are also very clean and well equipped. It is in the heart of Chinatown so very close to cheap local food markets and restaurants. Definitely worth the price considering how expensive Singapore is."
Great location. Clean. Kind.

Great value and amazing location. Clean and quiet. Would stay again!
"Great stay and super great location!

Fang was quick to respond and help with Questions. 

Loved my bed, always KO'd and slept well.

Expect shared amenities that are always clean and cleaned well!

MRT, Bus Stop, Maxwell Center, and Club St, all a few steps away."
"This place was actually way better than I expected it to be. I was a little worried to stay in china town, but the location actually was pretty amazing. It was really close to the MRT and the area it__ pretty nice and safe.

Sharing the bathrooms wasn__ a problem at all, I barely saw more people. Sound proof around the whole place is pretty good and the room was small, clean and stylish. 

I did have a little trouble checking in and later with the door lock because it ran out of battery, but they immediately helped me. 

I definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling on their own!"
"Fantastic hotel, so stylish and lots of living areas to chill out if you are a solo traveller. Free coffee was a lovely bonus, bathroom facilities are great and the self check-in is so convenient. Also loved the location! Lots to see in Chinatown not to mention the food _ºï_ would definitely recommend this place!"

"Nice clean place to stay. A new way of living - small rooms to get you out and about, and quality bed, pillows and sheets to give you what is needed in low cost accomodation. Fang was helpful on checkin too."
I had the most wonderful stay here while in Singapore. I would HIGHLY recommend it for other Airbnb guests. The service and wonderful disposition of the staff made my stay fantastic. My room was perfect and the shared spaces clean and wonderful. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
"Le logement etait conforme a nos esperance, tres propre, facile d'acces et il est vraiment facile de checkin et checkout depuis la platforme en ligne. Je le recomande!"
Great affordable hotel in the heart of Chinatown
"In addition to having the basics of cleanliness, air conditioning, and being relatively near subway station, you also get modern design and common area access to kitchen, fridge, free water, and locker use.  I would stay again.  If I travel with companion, I look forward to checking out their larger rooms"
"Most upscale hostel I__e been too, wouldn__ hesitate to book here again."

"If you like small cosy and comfortable sleeping amenities with neat and tidy shared facilities, then this place is definitely one to checkout!  A bonus too that it is conveniently located right near Chinatown!"
Perfect place
Small but comfortable listing for a layover that allowed me to walk around town. Walls are thin which is not an issue if the other guests are not yelling. All in all it is a good listing for what it is set up as. Check-in was very simple as well.
"I like this place! It has what is needed, check-in and check-out was practical, and the location was great. I passed by the Maxwell Food Hawker Centre for breakfast every morning I came to work, so it was an ideal spot. I'm not a fan of a windowless room, but to a certain point that worked out in my favor because it meant I didn't have to worry about outside illumination while I slept, haha! And my moments in the room were not that much to say that not having a window would affect me."

"Easily located a couple min walk next to the Chinatown MRT Station which makes it easy to get there From the Airport with on Change. The accommendation is located next to two Temples, street Food and my loved Food Market.
Check-in works via an online Tool which u are able to Start a couple of hours before arriving. A couple of Information such as Kredit Card Details und Passport are required. Rooms and restrooms are very clean and after check-out there is place to Store luggage (bring your own locker for the Storage room). All in all a very good place to stay!"
Perfect spot to stopover for a night in Singapore. Great location and easy to check-in/out. Good kitchen amenities and bathroom was pretty clean. Bed was clean and soft - I had a great sleep and the hosts were really easy to communicate with and responded quickly.
"stylish, modern place which gives people the luxurious vibes. overall, a nice cosy stay!"
good
"This is the second time I stayed at ST signature, once again my stay has been wonderful. I__ highly recommend it."
Perfectly located and  comfortable accommodation!
First this is a hostel not a hotel. It has a great location that can't be beat and I would stay here again just for the location. Walls are very thin though so you clearly hear the people next door or anyone walking by. I'm not a fan of shared bathrooms but again worth it for the location.
Great stay!
Definitely staying here again in the future!
"Good value, clean, nice place to stay. I__e returned and am on my second stay."
"Location was really central in Chinatown and close to most tourist attractions, clean & friendly hosts."
"Great place! Very clean, super close to everything, nearby restaurants and nightlife. The staff is super friendly and attentive, I really my stay! Thanks!"
"Perfect location. It's very close to food street, MRT station , 711 .  And u can check in online which is quite convenient. The shared bathroom is clean and well equipped . Don't worry. It's not crowded. U can barely meet someone at night. Everyone is so quite and i even overslept."
"Great location, enough space for single traveler, extremely clean! Surely I__l recommend to my friends"
"Really enjoyed staying here! The hosts were extremely helpful and provided me such a comfortable room! Very trendy space. Bathrooms were clean and I loved that coffee maker! Very welcomed experience after previously backpacking/staying in hostels throughout Asia. Great location near multiple food venues, train stations and a 7-11 across the street. Highly recommend!"
"Awesome place, suitable for those wanting simple but clean stay."
"Top place, lite on budget."
"Small space, yet everything you need. Great location right next to Chinatown. Very easy to explore... 5 min walk to Chinatown MRT. Very clean, and the free Coffee and Tea facilities were a great bonus! Would happily come back here again. Staff were very friendly too :)"
Hosts are very nice and keep in constant contact to ensure everything with stay is going well. Great location. Cabins are great have everything you need. Onsite facilities are excellent and the hotel is spotless clean. Would recommend.
Great spot _ bed is small but comfortable. Showers and bathrooms are extremely well cleaned and maintained. Common areas are stylish. Would stay here again
"Utilitarian, well-designed space with a small, but comfortable bed. Bathrooms were clean, and the fancy coffee maker was much appreciated. I'd stay here again if exploring Chinatown!"
"Unexpected cleanliness, will recommend and surely come back."

The room is exactly what's on the photos. Neat and good location
"Good place. Like a pod hotel but you get a pod room rather than just a pod bed. Very clean and modern. 

Only issue, the airconditioner was quite loud in my room and it needed to be on as the room was otherwise windowlesss/airless."
"If you looking for a place you stay, this is it."
Great location.  It is suitable for indepenpdent traveller.  The shared bathroom is clean.
Great to stay. thanks
Great place for independent travelers. Location is great. The cleanliness of the place was amazing even with having communal bathroom.
Perfect location. You must check out the bathroom on the top floor and find the hammock on the terrace... i had a very relax time there and so easy to go anywhere. Perfect for a first visit to singapore
"Great location, good value for money in Singapore. However, the lockers to temporarily store luggage are located outside the property, in a terrace hit by the sun, which makes impracticable to store a number of items there. However, they were attentive to the issue and offered me to store my items in another property nearby."
"quiet and clean,good place"
I actually live locally but was out of house for a few days. Awesome location quiet but literally within metres of vibrancy. Easy process. Great amenities. Clean and modern plus affordable. Have lockers onsite if you arrive early.
Above expectations. This hotel is the best choice for a single traveler.

Great location and space. Just know there are stairs!
"if you__e traveling in Singapore STAY WITH FANG! I__e been backpacking through asia for the last month and this is perfect no matter if you__e here on business, backpacking, with family, etc. it__ perfect. The space is very clean. Also quiet in sleeping areas, but a community feel in other places if you want to meet people. 

It__ also literally steps away from the Chinese market with the best shopping in Singapore for travelers. The Chinese market also had plenty of food and drinks too. You__e also situated next to bars on the other block, and Maxwell Market for fresh clean street food. On top of that you__e a 7 minute walk from MRT which will take you anywhere you need!

Fang as a host is one of the best out there. In my time backpacking I__e come across many, and he__ truly one of the kindest and most caring you can get. He really cares about you having a good time, and it shows. So, if you__e looking for a detailed and attentive host_ Fang is your person! Additionally, when you get to the listing, the staff working we__e all incredibly helpful and friendly.

Great stay, and I can__ recommend it enough. Cheers!"
Location is excellent! You walk outside and you're on a main street in Chinatown. The space is small but comfortable. The women's bathroom is up one floor and bathroom is very clean.
"Lovely place, conveniently located, would stay again."
Clean and tidy accommodation. The location is accessible to public transport. It was a great stay.
"Super cleaning and stylish hotel. Great location nearby Chinatown, MRT and tons of great food."
"Right in the middle of Chinatown, visible distance from Smith street.. very clean and modern! Highly recommend"
Amazing little place in a great location! Slept like a baby
Great spot to crash for a solo traveler like myself.
"Perfect minimalist room with everything you need.  The facilities are very clean and well designed...i didn't get to explore the building but I'm sure everything else was great too! 
Staff was super friendly and neighbors in the other rooms were quiet and courteous. The location is AWESOME!  Close to cute cafes and restaurants!  All around GREAT STAY!"

"Fang and the staff made sure that everything at the facility was going great. There were daily clean check up of the kitchen, tiolets, and showers. Very professional."
Nice place! Super cozy and easy to access from mrt. Room is clean and quiet at night.
"I was transferred to the Tanjong Pagar location instead of Chinatown - maybe I lucked out, it was a perfect location. The room was small but very very clean and comfortable. Was nervous about shared bathroom but rarely did I see anyone else in there and it seemed the toilets and shower were freshly cleaned any time I went in. The showers have a personal little changing area too, very hot water and nice waterfall shower head. Great price for Singapore, would stay here again. Also enjoyed the free coffee and filtered water!"
"I really wanted to like this place, as I was looking for a place to crash occasionally during my three months in Singapore. It was more economical than a hotel, but offered more privacy than a hostel. It was clean and quiet. The location was central and close to a few of my favorite spots. 

Staff was kind enough to switch me to a window room when I realized my mistake in booking a TV room. I appreciated the natural light and fun street view, but was disappointed that the windows didn__ actually open. (A closed room with recirculated air during the coronavirus outbreak wouldn__ have been my top choice.) The room itself was very small, with floor space slightly wider than a yoga mat, and just enough counter space to put my backpack and a few toiletries. The bunk had a nice light and shelf with outlets for charging devices.

There was no remote control for the AC unit, so adjusting the temperature in the middle of the night meant climbing down from my upper bunk. The bathroom was an epic trek down the full length of the hall, through the kitchen, around a corner, through a door and up a flight of stairs. 

There__ a small kitchen with fridge, water cooler and coffee maker, and large (outdoor, non-AC) lockers if you need to leave your things past checkout (bring your own lock). If you__e in town for a few nights and want an elevated (more private, comfortable) hostel experience, this may be your spot. Calling it co-living is a bit of a stretch, as it lacks onsite staff and any kind of social gathering area, but it was also much cheaper than the more genuine co-living spaces around town."
"Fantastic accommodation, great location in middle of Chinatown and around the corner of the best hawker food centre. Cannot fault the accommodation, it was clean and well organised. Only downside i found as staying there was that i paid almost double on the accommodation through airbnb compared to some of the other guests."
"Great place to stay - awesome communication and easy check in process. Comfortable bed and clean room, aircon works great. Toilets are clean and very well maintained."
Nice host. Clean space and modern.
it__ a good place to stay
"Great value overall,  good location too."

Great place
This place is a go-to for anyone seeking a cosy communal stay!
Fanstatic place !
"Good location, close to many amenities and FANTASTIC interior from the rooms to the bathrooms to the kitchen. The value provided was worth its price. Ten out of ten would recommend."
Just book it. You won't regret it.
"Even though I was at the hotel at the time of lockdown, I didn't feel lke I'm unsafe sharing the amenities with other guests, thanks to all the measures taken for our safety and comfort ;)
I do recommend to pay a little bit extra and get a room with a window, I stayed 5 days in a room without a window, it was nice but got me a little depressed, well sunshine matters, then I moved to a room with window for another 5 days - great great experience!"
Comfortable bed..very convenient to public transport.
Great place to stay..Would recommend my friends visiting Singapore
Comfy and surely will come back and book another room from this hotel
This place is better then tanjong pagar less crowded and more spacious
Cool place!

Simple yet affordable. Recommended for those solo travellers who needs a place to spend the night. Conveniently located near the train station too. Host was attentive and helpful throughout the stay. Will look forward to my next visit.
I had a pleasant experience
Value for money in every way !
"Nicely designed new co-living hotel in the heart of Chinatown.

Great place to go about exploring the city and Singapore.

Good cheap and or expensive nice food and watering holes all around you. 

Easy to move about with 3 different MRT lines within a 500m radius.

The cleaning staff Cui Yuan and her team sets a very high standard of cleanliness in the rooms and common space. The WC is cleaned and wiped dry every few hours so you don__ get to see any dirty messy shared toilets like other shared hostels."
"The room was clean and cost, and the facilities very reasonable for the price. It__ centrally located in the city and in terms of food, you can just cross the road to enjoy a wide variety. There__ a 7-11 across the road too. Overall, high marks for price and convenience."
"Fang__ place was a pleasant surprise in Singapore - it was close to Chinatown and the Maxwell Centre (for great food), and was only a 20-25 minute walk from almost every tourist attraction. The room was clean, the AC and wifi worked well, and the bed was very comfortable! Fang__ place also provides visitors with any necessary amenities, and there were staff present 24/7 to assist with any concerns! We thoroughly enjoyed our time in Singapore, and would recommend ST signature to any one travelling to Singapore in the future."
Great location from MRT and lots of food choices nearby! There__ a convenient shop opposite to satisfy your midnight cravings too. Rooms were really clean and comfortable!
"Convenient location, close to Chinatown MRT, place and location is accurate as per write-up on the St Signature website. Some info that might be useful (not found on website) -  Shared toilets/bathrooms on 2nd  floor are female only, 3rd floor are male only and 4th floor are for everyone. Check-in is strictly only at 3PM (as the automated system will send an email with the door passcode through only at 3PM). The place completely met expectations, great for a short stay if you're out for most of the day and looking for a cool, clean, comfortable place to rest at night!"
The location was great so it was very comfortable to travel. Both toilets and our room was clean. I want to use here if I come singapore next time.
"Clean room! For one who has a long day trip and just want a tiny private space to lie down, i would recommend to come here.

Until next time!"
Great location close to Chinatown!
"Great location in the heart of Chinatown, clean and private. Would definitely stay again!"

Located in the middle of Chinatown. Great access to the MRT station. Very clean and also cheap. Staffs are very helpful. If you are thinking to stay in China town I__ strongly recommend.
"Great host, beautiful, stylish hostel, the best location, close to metro station, food courts, drink bars and anything one might need. Recommended!"
"Super nice and stylish place, was so surprise, nice host nice place will definitely come back again!"
"This is my second time booking with ST Signature within a month. And same as before, it__ a great place with a great location for a temporary stay. :)

I will book with them again."
"Great amenities, sparkling clean and perfect for getting out into wider Singapore and coming back to. Nearby to amazing local food and China town. Recommend."
Nice place - would go there again!
Great location right across from tons of incredible food and views in Chinatown. The room with the window feels spacious and sophisticated even with the limited square footage. The shared washroom is gorgeous.
"Room and bead was very nice, though extremely narrow. Location is fabulous, and staff was very accommodating.

However, the shared bathroom was a terrible experience.  The showers had absolutely no place to put clothing, so I had to enter the space in my towel. It is unisex, so I am sure it was uncomfortable for the females that used the space simultaneously with me."

Place very nice and clean
Location is excellent.
The bathrooms are sparkling clean and gorgeous. The community areas are nice to hang out and the whole place is really clean. Strategic location and smells amazing when you walk in.
Perfect location for going to hawkers and exploring Chinatown in general. Very nice bathrooms and quiet rooms.
"Had a lovely stay at the hotel. Easy check in (via a third party website) meant that I could arrive late without any problems. The shared bathroom makes this more of a hostel then a hotel, but the experience was very easy. Very clean and well-designed, and great location close to bars and restaurants."
"Clean organized space, with sufficient amenities. Though the reception is no physically manned, but the online chat & check in is quick & hospitable"
"Very good location, clean and quickly response"
"Sehr sauberes und gut organisiertes Hotel mit Self-Checkin. Die Lage ist super! Es gibt gratis Kaffee und Tee und sehr praktisch sind auch die Schlie_fÃ¤cher, welche man vor oder nach dem Check-In/Out nutzen kann (man benÃ¶tigt ein eigenes VorhÃ¤ngeschloss)."
Great location and super comfy bed.. everything so clean too.  The host was very good with communication to help answer any questions.  Enjoyed our stay here.
"Nice, cosy and comfortable place but bad is a shared bathroom .."

The room too small for the couple room.....

Good place
Great location in front of chinatown food center. Room was clean although I got a corner room which is smaller and long but I feel it is enough space. Bathroom is shared with many people in the hotel but it was clean. Kitchen area is clean too and amenities are great especially if you want to cook or heat up food.
It__ very convenient to check in and check out. The place is clean too.
Good price for the place

"We stayed at the hostel one night and it was truly comfortable. Everything worked extremely well, from check-in to check-out. The room was cozy, well equipped and the bathrooms super clean. We would do it again!"
"Great location, very clean, all-around really great and stylish hostel. We thought it was strange that there was no lock to the main door (so anyone could walk in and out of the building and through the stairwells/halls), but other than that it was adequate. Great for if you're not planning on spending much time inside, as the room is EXTREMELY small! Could not even open our suitcases inside."
This place is very superb. If you want to stay at Singapore this is great choice.
"lots and lots of stairs, and our room was right next to the main door so we could hear people coming in and out a lot which was bad but the room itself was clean and great"
"Overall place is very nice. The building is nice, the room and bathroom is nice, just like the pictures. its actually clean, unless the blanket is very thin and i can see its quite dirty.. and the other thing is.. i stayed here for 3 nights and there's no one's gonna clean your room/ make your bed, so its a little messy in the end.. 
location is quite far from mrt , around 10 mins walk to somerset MRT , but in front there's bus stop and grab wheels, there's not much around the place, you have to walk at least 5 mins to find the nearest supermarket and restaurant. 
but overall experience is very nice, recommended, since its somehow much cheaper than other hotel & places."
"Lovely location, modern facilities, close to the shopping district, highly recommend this stay"
"The room was nice, all amenities are the same as described. We did found some cockroaches, however the host were quick to respond and the staff were so helpful. Overall, we have nice experience staying there. Thank you!"
"Overall great stay in BC__ house. The room not so spacious but it__ enough for 4 people. Facilities are great and modern. 
There was a bus stop in front of the house so it__ easy to reach many places."
Clean and nice place. Only a short 15-20 mins walk from Orchard. Overall great experience and will stay again.
"Good looking place! Check in and check out was smooth. We only stayed for two nights but overall we__e happy with the stay. A bit pricy as everything else in Singapore.
 5 minute walk until nearest minimarket. But we really liked the modern look of the apartment!

The communication was really good. He explained very specific how to get to the apartment with a few alternatives and their price rage.

Thank you for our stay B.C!"
"The whole room was sparkling clean, including with all the ammenities listed by the host. The staff also helped us very much during the check-in and check-out. It was just a little bit far from the MRT station (nearest was about 0.7km), but I will totally stay here again if I visit Singapore next time. Highly recommended and thankyou very much for the hospitality_"
Great place
"I stayed in Jay__ place for 2 months and couldn__ be happier with the property! Communication was great, always received responses within minutes and they catered to our every need. Although the apartment isn__ big, the building passed our expectations by miles as there__ so much space on different floors to chill out. If I ever went to Singapore again I__ definitely come back to Jay__ property :)"
"Excellent customer services and  location! There is pretty much everything you need in the condo and restaurants, coffee shops and supermarkets are close by. You can walk to Arab street and Suntec city for shopping. Nicoll Highway mrt station is 200 meters away and you can use city gate link to get there. You won__ get wet even if it rains. Only problem (very minor) i had is since it is off the main street, expect some traffic noises. Enjoyed my stay here. Highly recommend it."
"Small but adequate space in a lovely location. Has everything you need, but I would really recommend max 1 guest, you'll be cramped with 2 or more.

This particular unit is on the 23rd floor which gives you a lovely view towards downtown. Do note that at around 820 every morning the fountains on level 24 will turn on, and this is very audible from this unit. 

Jay is great, answered any question and resolved any problem really quickly.

Thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and can recommend."
"We rented the apartment because of the great reviews and pictures on the listing.

The common areas (pool, gym, 24th floor) were AMAZING! 

The location is great. The complex is located next to Kampong Glam (bars, restaurants, shops) and is close to two subway stations (Nicoll Highway (yellow line) and Bugis (green and blue line)). If you enjoy shopping the two malls Bugis+ and Bugis Junction are just a short walk away. Next to the complex you'll also find a small hawker centre that serves cheap food (3-5 SGD)

The apartment itself is good, but the communication with the hosts and cleanliness issues took away from the experience, and  made us feel that we didn't get value for money.

Also,  we had to leave the apartment in advance because our airline cancelled all flights because of the Covid-19 situation and rebooked us with another earlier flight. 

We were both surprised and saddened by the lack of understanding and the fact that they wouldn't refund anything for the days we didn't get to spend in the apartment. We lost a lot of money and expected them to show some goodwill during these hard times."
Enjoyed our stay very much. The unit is in good & clean condition. Jay & team is very responsive and professional. Would highly recommend this cosy place to others!
"Perfect place, nice staff, very nice nighborhood"
"Good place to stay. Location is good. Fast response, quick check in. They clean your room everyday. Room is good enough for 2. Location is very near the bus stop so everything is near. Other side is full of restos, bars. They said its red district but other side is a quiet neighborhood. I will stay again here :)"
"Die Lage ist in Ordnung, ca. 10 min zur Metro, 2 min zu einer Bushaltestelle. 
Sauberkeit der Zimmer ist dem Preis nicht angemessen. In der Beschreibung wird Ã¼ber ein __eubau_ geschrieben. Dies ist nicht der Fall, die Zimmer sehen schon sehr benutzt aus. Klimaanlage funktioniert, stinkt aber und wirkt dreckig. 
Zimmer sind sehr hellhÃ¶rig, man hÃ¶rt zum Beispiel die anderen GÃ¤ste im Flur oder den Aufzug. 
Gastgeber ist freundlich."
"Nice location, easy to travel around, extremely good value for money, clean, not too big and not too small.
A bit noisy during the night, but not too much.
Very suggested"
Big enough for 2 people. Plenty of 24 hour eateries nearby. Room was clean overall and bed was very comfy.
"Nice and simple.
New, clean, good amount of space for the price point, and the balcony is huge. 
Alvin and team at location were kind and helpful. Couldn't ask for more."
"Clean rooms, worth the money"
Good cozy place
is a very good place n nice place..the owner is very nice n friendly..next time i will come back to stay again..
Good place to stay when you have a quick visit in Singapore
Place is exactly as described.
"Great place to stay. Walking distance to National Stadium, lots places to eat nearby."
Very nice place n clean easy to go finding public transportation
"Great affordable place. Safe, clean with friendly faces"
Nice place and esay to go everywhere
Good location
A great place to stay with and people here are friendly
"Very bad experience ! Don__ reserve if you want to change the dates of your stay ! 2 nights billed if I want to change !! No kitchen, no fridge etc. Loud noise while sleeping... 
Never return again !"
"I just wanna say thank you to Alvin's place for their excellent service, nice place to relax, nice hospitality. They are well kept in good location and safe. The wifi is good and the house keepers are well accomodating. His place is accessible. Very near at mrt station and the market, restaurant is very near to his place."
"The accommodation suits the duration of our stay. Nothing was overly prepared nor insufficient for a comfortable rest. That is of course from my point of view in general. I would recommend this to couples or business folks only on a short stay.

For the location, price wise wasn't cheap nor overly charged. It's a quiet building overall with little commotion from the exterior surroundings.

Although a few things might irk some foreigners such as (this is just my experience)
Ants in the electric kettle(welcome to the tropics mate)
Stained walls(at least in my unit lavender 08-02)
Dusty air conditioning filters(not a deal breaker really)
The washing area on the roof is first come first serve basis
Toiletries provided such as the toothbrush is cheap and easily come apart from the brush fibres(you should be bringing your own to  begin with)

Location wise is near the red light district, but it does not bother us one bit as we are normally back in the room before working hours during the night.

Easy for food delivery to wait at the gate to collect your meals on a lazy night.

Not overly crowded and close to a few malls via bus or train ride.

For the ladies, hair dryer IS provided just get it from the counter or request from the room attendees if you see them around.

Note that the room attendees will come into your room to clear your bath towel, bed sheets and general cleaning to keep things tidy. Oh, and 2 bottles of mineral water is provided as well.

PS: Prepare $1 coins for the washing machine and dryer on the roof($5 for washing, $3 for dryer) 

Would I come back again? Yes, as it covers what I require just fine
Would I recommend to other ppl? Depends on their taste in accommodation :x"
"Very nice place and very good value for money. Clean and convenient. All personal very kind and helpful. Access to public transportation at few minutes walking giving easy access to any place in Singapore.
I recommend the place for anybody not willing to spend a fortune in hotels."

"This is a nice place for travellers! Good location, 3 min walk to Mountbatten MRT station and 4 min walk to Aljunied station. The room is clean and has attached toilet and bathroom, very convenient. The staff are friendly and communication with them is very efficient. A good choice for those who want to travel in Singapore!"
"Alvin's place was covenient to airport. If you are looking for place where is close to airport, that is great place. Always someone was in the office. It was helpful. One thing, there were many ants in the room even on the bed. So the short term was no problem but I might not stay fpr long term."
"Lee's place was clean albeit small. Communication was good. The location is rather central. Somerset mrt is a walkable distance but not very near and walking during the day or with luggage can really wear you out especially due to the scorching heat. You can also walk to Killiney road where there is a 24 hour mart and a few tasty eateries. Do note that the walkways are mostly uncovered and the weather can be rather hot and humid. There is a bus stop is right at the doorstep of the unit and there are frequent connecting busses to mrt stations. This made travelling very convenient. Otherwise, the unit itself is pretty basic but met our needs for a short holiday. Felt it was a little pricey for an airbnb but maybe that is how it is in Singapore.  A brief guide on the busses that pass through and where they take you to (as in attractions/mrt/airport route) will be immensely useful to tourists. Thank you!"
This room is rather small but it is immaculately clean and modern (great TV with Netflix) and fairly central to all the main areas in Singapore. We were welcomed on arrival and instructed on the facilities. So all in all a good spot in the city.
"Great place, clean and the location is great only 20mins walk down to orchard road. We would recomend this to anyone who comes to singapore."
"Room was bigger than I expected. Although the host allowed earlier check-in, it took quite long for the manager to check us in because he was dealing with so many other airbnb hosts in other rooms."
"Very responsive host and convenient location. Bus stops just outside building entrance and walking distance to supermarket, restaurants, wine shop and Orchard Road."
"_¸ì__¸ê__ __ ì¹_____ê³, __ ê¹___©ë__!"
"I had amazing time here. Regina is a very nice, generous & friendly host. The house is much wonderful than what I expected. Feel like home, and it is very clean. As a person allergy to cats, I could stay here without any sick symptoms. Highly recommend!"
cozy space for the weekend!
"I am so happy live in Jayna's house, the house is clean and the bed is soft. Jayna is very very nice, she is glad to share her story to us and take us to some interesting places. And I am so surprised received my birthday gift from jayna. We become best friend now. A perfect travel!
I hope you can reach your dream and still kind and positive to the world. Like you said something that we hope will arrived sooner or later.
See you next time jayna! best wishes to you!"
"Jayna has a fine sense of aesthetics, and the pictures does a good job of showcasing the small cosy living room space guests will be staying in. It is a 10 minute walk from the Punggol MRT station. 

The host is warm yet mindful about guests' privacy since it was a co-living space with herself.

Unfortunately we did not fully enjoy our stay since the mattress wasn't available then, and the toilet water pressure was insufficient/inconsistent."
"Jayna___å­__æ£,äº¤é___¹ä¾¿,å±__ä½__å¾_!"
"He is very responsive, and helpful. The place is really great"
"The room is of great location but the building is over 40 years old, so you cannot expect much for the common area maintenance. Within the room is okay, except my room is small, only suit for single person who do not mind squeezy place and the toilets are a bit small as well. Pros and cons."
Great location and this place looks out over a green area and a tree.  No need to close any blinds as the natural light was great to have everyday!
"Christines place was fantastic. Great location right in the heart of Club St.  All the best food and wine venues located only meters from the apartment.  It can be a little noisy on the weekend, however its part of the fun and vibe of the district and did not bother us at all. Check in was easy and the staff at the apartment were accomodating and helpful. I would stay here again."
Excellent apartment in best location
"The location is good, the apartment is large enough for a group of 4 people. We hated the bathroom that was not clean at all, water was leaking on the floor, the bathcurtain was really dirty."
Ideal location! My family enjoyed their stayed in Singapore.
"We were staying at Christine__ place for 3 nights and it was great. It is located within 5 min walk to Chinatown MRT station so it__ easy if you would like to travel around Singapore. You can find lots of nice bars and restaurants in the surrounding area and we find at least two food center around the place where you can enjoy local food and one with famous chicken rice (with a long queue of course LOL). The place is more than enough for 2 people, clean, all equipment working well, and the building has an elevator so you dont have to worry about carrying big luggage. If they can add a microwave in the unit that__l be perfect :-) in overall im happy staying at Christine__ place and surely will stay again on our next visit."
"The apartment in a great location, and was larger than we expected. We had a good stay."
"The apartment is in a very cool area, next to bars and shops, few steps from the metro station of China Town. The overall stay was ok even though the apartment could have been better cleaned or serviced (the bathroom is still leaking and the shower curtain still filthy)."

"Nice and spacious place (for Singapore), very close to excellent restaurant and the CBD."
"i really liked the fact that we got a good place for such a price! but, i really do think that the bathroom needs a little upgrading because the flooring has already came off and it__ really quite slippery. and also, there__ always a weird smell that lingers in the apartment when we first enter it, but it goes away after a few minutes (i guess because we got used to it?) the view isn__ really anything magnificent but we don__ mind it at all because we kept the windows all closed anyway! i also really like that the washing machine is actually a 2 in 1 and it comes with a dryer so we managed to wash our clothes in it! so i would suggest bringing maybe small bottles of detergent to wash your clothes!:) thank you for replying my messages really fast too!"
Awesome experience staying here. Will book it next time
Great stay
Awesome
Nice and cozy place!

Nice and clean place. Check in and out is hassle free. Good location with lots of food and bar choices. Will come back again.

"Very accessible, easy check in, spacious room with perfect layout"
Nice and easy access.  Check in was a breeze.
Okay.
"This room doesn__ get much sunshine and there was humid. A cockroach was in showeroom.
But this room has Nice location, easy access to the MRT station (Chinatown). 
Good value for money."
The location is awesome with many things going on nearby. It__ a cosy and comfy place to stay.
Clean and best place to stay
Clean and stylish place. Very comfy and is located at a very good location

"This place was just as displayed in the pictures. The location is great, near to both Chinatown and the main CBD and the mrt is close too.  

There is a person at the front desk who is helpful and allowed us to leave our luggage whne we arrived early and also until our late flight which is something lots of airbnbs don't have which was so convenient.

A couple of notes for potential other guests:
- there aren't curtains (there are some wooden blinds but they don't block everything) so it gets bright in the morning
- there are some bars nearby which is convenient but also can be loud at night
- there's no shampoo so bring your own (there's body wash)
- the TV seemed to have only 6 channels and not all in english

Despite the above, would definitely stay here again as those are only minor comments and the convenience of this place was great."

Place is nice and suitable for couples but not much convenient with family with kids.
Good location but lacks details. Large space with kitchen is a plus. Couch far more comfortable than the bed.
Great
convenient and has alot of eatery place. =)
"I've stayed here numerous times and will stay again. Convenient location and easy to get in and out of the building as it is on street level. MRT and downtown less than 5 minute walk away. Large grocery store about 8 mins walk away. Host and team are very friendly, responsive and helpful. Apartment is as seen in the photos. Lots of big windows with shutters and can be opened which is nice in the evenings. Larger than most apartments in this area."
Wifi is almost non-existent. Couch has stains and smells like body odour. Place is small and cozy. Host replies quickly. TV has no Netflix (no point also since the wifi is so bad). Highly recommend future travellers to bring their own hdmi wires.
"I was dissappointed with the stay as it turned out worse than expected. Although the room was neat, tidy and clean as what it was shown, the Wifi in the room was terrible. Additionally, there was no response from the Host via (Hidden by Airbnb) which was a huge letdown too.. what__ making it worse was the noise at night as it was located nearby bars and pubs."
Nice and comfy place
Very good location.
"Great location, very good double glaze window sound proof from the noise on street. Fast respond from host. Thanks!!!"
The place is centrally located with great bistros and eateries nearby. Doors are slightly thin however. Overall a pleasant stay.
"Great place to stay, spacious for 2 persons, clean and maintained. Photos resembles the apartment."
"Place is cozy and nice. Nearby to lots of restaurants. Walking distance to Maxwell Hawker where you can experience local delights. Alternatively, Korean food is just next street. Overall, I enjoyed the hospitality provided by host."

"Very easy to check in, and centrally located, nearby delicious and interesting bars and restaurants. Also near Ann Siang Hill which I went for a peaceful stroll."
Great location and apartment. Easy check in and responsive host.
Great apartment and great location.
A nice and centrally located place
"Overall a good homestay for 6 pax! Cozy, tidy & spacious. Nice location near good restaurants and train station easy to get around."
"Arons place was great, very close to the bus station and 8 min walk to MRT stn. The neighborhood was great too, very close to local restaurant , supermarket (which sell cheap mineral water), and as a muslim traveler theres an indian restaurant 24 hours that sells halal food. Great place for family trip and infant."
Very nice place to stay. Very helpful beyond just being a host.
Nice host. The place is convenience to access to city. Many of restaurants near apartment.
"Christine__ apartment is located right at the heart of ChinaTown, only steps away from the vibrant nightlife along walking streets with bars, restaurants and shop houses. The apartment is amazingly clean and well maintained. I would highly recommend this place for future travelers to Singapore!"
"Perfect location for tourists,  sparkling clean rooms  awesome amenities. Good response from the host"
Perfect location and super fast answers from Christine! Will definetly come back!
"Nice place, good location. Everything as expected."
"Great location, lovely view. Would definitely recommend to saty here for business and leisure travel."
"The location is absolutely amazing, that was the only positive thing about this apartment!
- it is really small (pictures misleading!) and not convenient at all as there is no storage apart from a tiny wardrobe.
- it maybe ok for one person, but not a couple with two kids...
- it__ not really clean, dust everywher and walls dirty.
- not even a survival kit for cleaning 
- very noisy works downstairs (we were not informed even though we asked for a quite apartment in the residence)."
"Location is great. Bed comfortable and interior modern and new. Ling room is large, kitchen space ok, bed room a bit tight on one side of the bed. Bathroom only sufficient for 1 person so a bit too small.
The house accommodate many apartments with I guess different sizes. We stood in apartment 04-05 which I do not recommend for 4 person as bad room is quite small with limited space. As well wardrobe just fit for 2 person.
Everything below eye level was clean but above there was dust on lamps and cupboards. Housekeeping could be better in this sense. Currently there is a construction side beside the house and is quite noisy from 8am till 7pm. As the pilling work is just ongoing I think it will take another year till construction is finish.

There is a Helpdesk to be called (the host always asked to contact them) in case you have a problem with the apartment but the Helpdesk is not really willing to help. First, despite complain and asking for cleaning at the end we needed to clean the exhaust grill in the bathroom by yourself as the grill was full of dust which falls down when switching on the light.
Secondly in the 2nd night the AC was not anymore working properly so we needed to sleep at open windows with the fan on. As there are a lot of bars around and the exhaust of one of the bar's kitchen was directing to the house the smell was imminent. And as the temp. at night will not fall below 26 it was not nice. Despite complaining in the morning next day, they just come back in the late afternoon saying that the settings at the AC remote was wrong. Checking by themselves a hour later they needed to amid that it is the AC. Means we had another night without AC. 
Only after massive complains they were able to repair the AC the next day at noon.

Despite this, I still can recommend the apartment for 2 persons."
"Location is awesome, would highly recommend the Outram / Chinatown neighborhood to everyone. HOWEVER, as someone how travels often & has many positive Airbnb reviews, I would not recommend this particular unit. 
There was zero communication from the host, who was out on leave(?), & our reservation was never communicated to the building & cancelled half way through our stay in the evening. This building is not friendly toward Airbnb & I would urge anyway to find another spot in this neighborhood. 
If you do stay here, good luck! It has a great washing machine."
"Amazing place and amazing hosts. Guided and directed me to the place as well as the check-in instructions with clarity and patience.

The place looks wonderful and comfy. A true sweet home feels, perfect for a staycation. Would definitely recommend!"
Overall is good juz that no tissue n washing hand soap don__ have
"If you are looking for a great place for staycation with amazing amenities, look no more as this is the one."
Clean and in a great location! No issues checking in and the space was comfy.
Good
"Misunderstood the statement, this is not for overlay. But good location near the city can have few hours rest here during flight transfer."
Great place to rest.

and it__ a walking distance to some stores..7-11 also..
thanks Aaron Kevin.."
Good place
"It was ok. Singapur Is very expensive, so we decided for a cheaper flat. But their were a lot of ants when we arrived. In the whole flat. That was the whole time. 
Fotos not like That on air bnb. The fridge was really old and dirty. In on bedroom should be 3 beds and there were only 2. that was a little problem because we were 4 people. My wife, me and our two children."
Really nice guy to talked to. Very kind and helpful as he provided all the info on how to get to his place.  Excellent location with many food courts around and located very near mrt station. One of the best host i ve met so far.
Perfect place for  those who prefer privacy and quiet environment
I love this apartment. It's very nice and quiet and very good for rest. It's also very near MRT and eateries.
"Brandon responded to queries very quickly and communicated really well.
I did enjoy the quietness of the house which made my stay more relaxing. The smooth in/out accessed within the flat everyday was also great.
The location of his place was fantastic for me, a few minutes walk to the bus stop, woodlands point, supermarket, hawkers are just below the building and the 24hr laundry service.
I had a great time and be back if needs arises.
Highly recommended place."
Good
Thank you.
Nice
Great host and place to stay in!
"Clean, Nice view, Good swimming pool. Satisfied overall."

"There's no problems with the flat, very basic and also very clean. The location is a bit far from the centre but you can easily get to the nearest Mrt station which is the downtown line that can take you to the city. If you like peace and greenery away from the hustle and bustle of he city, then this is a flat worth staying at."
Nice place
Strongly recommended for the host the place and all. Especially host is very helpful. Thumbs up!!!
"Basic but very clean. Single bed, fan, AC, shared bathroom, fast WiFi, ability to use the on-site gym and pool"
"For a single traveller, it is the best choice to stay, near china street food, business district, cool restaurants inhouse, live music on weekends"
Awesome location. Exactly as described. This was my second time in this area and we loved it to every bit! Highly recommended A+++.
Great for longer stay in Singapore.
"Lovely clean apartment, prompt responses from the host, kind service staff, great location. The apartment suited our family of 5 very well"
Great place ! Great location if you have a car and the view is fantastic
Great location for exploring Singapore!
Amazing and responsive host!!! The location is spot on and very easy to navigate around the city. Fantastic view and quite area. Very homie feeling. Highly recommend this house.
"The room is clean, and the location is quite convenient as it is near two mrt stations. The room has an attached washing room. Given the charge, it is a nice bargain. The only issue is with the WiFi as the signal was weak during night."
Nice and friendly place.
"the place is okay, just a bit smelly in the entrance corridor"
Clean and spacious. Nice place to stay for family.
Great location and great service!
"This is a good, clean, well kept place, only 6 minutes walk to local eating places and 10 minutes walk to Orchard Gateway. I found the place to be like the pictures and would go back for sure."
"Ideal location. Excellent and friendly check-in. Pricy, but then again, Singapore is pricy. Be aware that only one of the bedrooms has doors that open to the outside to let natural light in. There are no windows."
The studio appartment is great and location is also ideal. Seems very new and clean.
"Location was good, you could walk around 12 mins to Somerset, though there is literally a bus stop in front of the apartment and across the road. There is a small Chinese restaurant next door as well if you ever just wanted a quick bite.   The place is very hotel like, you get your own room with a bathroom and at down stairs lobby there is a place where you can get coffee, hot water and cold water. You could even check your emails at the computer. Our room was at the top floor and there are stairs to the room so be mindful of this when you have a lot of luggage! There is no windows in the room we were in so if you don__ like that and feel claustrophobic then you may want to reconsider, I had no issues.  The wifi switched off once and the electricity, but after a message and a call someone was quick to fix it, so coms was good.  The place was clean, modern, comfortable bed so would recommend it as a good place to stay."

Reasonable place small rooms but brand new
"This place has all the essentials, was very clean and host was accommodating, we would have stayed longer if it weren__ so popular! We definitely recommend it."
"Good location! Place is really clean & nice! super great for short term stay & the place is easily accessible, near bus stop convenient for travellers/locals! the television also has netflix/youtube function! :-)) thank you for the awesome hospitality @ owner!!"
Nice place. Very quiet and safe.
"Good place, host is responsive and conveniently located in the heart of Singapore"
Value for money!
"Nice  place, safety and privacy"
"Smooth check-in procedure, great hospitality by the owner and situated in a very nice neighbourhood with close proximity to the MRT. Definitely recommended!"
"Thank you Kelvin for making our trip to Sing more fulfilled with your amazing hospitality and thoughtful care, really nice apartment and good food. It__ so easy and fast to get to the nearest MRT. The room was comfortable with a king bed and has a working table if anyone needs to use laptop. There__ a swimming pool in the condominium, good view to chill but we didn__ have enough time. Good value vs the price. Will stay there again next time. "
Great place
"Kelvin was very friendly, and even cooked me some food when I arrived after midnight, the condo was very comfortable, and 100 meters from MRT, I wouldn't hesitate to stay there next time I am back in Singapore"
Nicht zu empfehlen
"Good value for money,easy to find,good private parking."
very good

"Kelvin's place is well located, he is a great host, and I had a restful sleep. I wish I had more time to enjoy his local tips, but sure I will book with him again."
"Kelvin place is at a perfect location, very easy to get around with public transportion.His place is great, very clean and has everything you need. Kelvin was also very helpful since the beginning, available at all times whenever we had any questions. Totally recommend it"
Good!
"Host was great, provided detailed pictures making it easy to make our way there. Met us at train station which is only a few minutes from accommodation. Met all our needs for the night we were there and allowed us to leave our luggage there post check out to explore more Singapore before late flight out. Great location, beautiful pool which we unfortunately didn't get to enjoy. Will definitely stay there again."
"Kelvin is friendly host and quick responding to your enquire.

Location is close to Tanah Merah MRT station just 2-3 mins walks.

Room & toilet are clean.

You can take GrabCar for nearby convenience store just for $5 

Would recommend this place when you are in Singapore!"
"Kelvin is a nice, fun and helpful host! And his place is super stylish and really good location close to the MRT (subway/tube) with super easy and short distance to the airport and it's also very easy to get to anywhere in Singapore because the MRT is good connected :) I will definitely stay here again when I'm in Singapore!"

"We had a great stay at Kelvins place.  Kelvin is a friendly and helpful host! He took us on a quick tour to the center on the first day, with a lot of tips on what to do. The apartment is convenient located close to the metro, easy to get around. The pool is awesome, perfect after a hot day in the city!"
"Gut gelegene Unterkunft. Easy vom Flughafen zu erreichen, MRT Station ist direkt um die Ecke. Von hier kommt man auch super in die Stadt. Wir wÃ¼rden jederzeit wiederkommen :)"
Kelvin is an awesome host! Very positive and happy to have a chat with you. My flight only landed at 1am but Kelvin had made a plan for me to check in after hours. I was even offered a home cooked meal on my arrival which was great. The place was just as advertised. Would definitely recommend staying with Kelvin to anyone coming to Singapore for a couple days!
Nice owner and the house is very clear. Good location. Good price. Will visit again.
"Very simple room in a family condo apartment, ideal for a one night transit near the airport, but maybe not for a longer stay.

1 minute walk from Tanah Merah MRT station, which is 12 minutes away from airport, 1$ USD with train or 8$ with Grab Taxi.

Kelvin was very helpful and nice in every way possible, even though I never met him! 

I would have appreciated toilet paper in the toilet (I found a reserve under the sink) and a towel for shower but I am sure that will be corrected easily.

One thing was strange, in the morning, while preparing coffee I realized someone was sleeping on a mattress, on the floor, in the living room, near the table kitchen. It made me a bit uncomfortable.

Ideal for staying one night prior to departure from the airport the next morning."
"We had an overnight layover in Singapore so we didn__ need much on the amenities side but we did want an entire place to ourselves.The place looks much nicer in the pictures and it wasn__ an entire place to ourselves. We were met at the MTR stop and led into the apartment. Not by Kelvin but by his partner (super nice, slight communication barrier). We dropped off our things and headed out for the day. We got back pretty late and it was unfortunate we had to be careful about making noise since we knew there were people sleeping. Overall, we realize that you get what you pay for. For a layover it worked since it was so close to the MTR and 2 stops away from Changi. Like previously mentioned,just a heads up, don__ expect to see what__ in the pictures and you__e not getting the entire place to yourself."
Thanks Kelvin.. you are the best..

"AMAZING LOCATION & HOST!! Close to airport. Kevin met me at train when I got off. It was so easy to get to his place. His location made it easy to go directly to where I needed to see. Safe area. Very beautiful home, safe gated area and Kevin gave me SO much travel tips. Thank you. Highly recommend."

"Kelvin is a great host , calm behaviour and helpful with everything , and if we talk about singapore this is the best bnb."
Good value for money at Kelvins place. Great location and a very organised host.
"We checked in at Kelvin__ place at 1:30am and we haven__ had dinner yet. At first he offered to show us where the eating place is, but we had kids with us, so he cooked food for us instead, so that the kids could rest already. I love how the place is so close to the MRT station. It__ very easy to go places even if it__ far from the city. It__ only a station away from Changi airport so it__ easy to go the airport even with huge luggages! Our kids love the pool. You just have to be very careful not to make a noise if you__e going for a swim at night. If you__e traveling with kids, better bring a pair of slippers. The bathroom tiles are a bit slippery for kids and toddlers if they__e barefooted. Also, since it__ a shared room, just a heads up if you have highly overactive kids. It__ kinda hard to tell them to tone down their noise all the time, since they might disturb other guests. The AC takes a bit of a long time to make the room cool, but it will be fine after about an hour. You just need to turn on the fan also at first. Overall, we loved the place. Great hosts. Value for money. Would recommend it, and we could stay here again."
The place is really strategic. It was so easy to reach airport from this place. The owner also gave us a detailed direction so we didn't find any difficulties to reach his place.
"Great location and nice hosting , facilities. 
I recommend"
"Kevin was very quick to response and organise my check in. The bed was comfy and I slept well. I stopped over for one night before I flew - very close to the airport but also very close MRT. 
Thank you Kevin for a pleasant stay."
"Kelvin was very communicative with check in instructions and very accommodating to us as we needed to check in late at night. However, his wife checked us in and didn__ really do a thorough check in. We had to ask where the towels were ourselves. We asked the wife in person and Kelvin (through (Hidden by Airbnb) ) but Kelvin only responded the next day after we had already checked out hours ago. All in all, the place was tidy and sufficient enough for us as a place to sleep at night."
Not recommended
"The place is perfect for a transit traveler with a morning-scheduled next flight. Only few minutes away from Tanah Merah station, and around 10-15 minutes from Changi. The host also gives clear instruction to follow for check in, but you have to follow each of the details. The room was cozy and the amenities were great. More than enough for a night transit.

Thank you, Kelvin!"
"Kelvin's wife met us upon arrival. The details re. finding the key and how to get to the 3B tower and access the room were perfect. The location is perfect for easy travel to the airport, just 15mins by MRT. There are about a dozen restaurants a 10mins walk from the apartment and we enjoyed a very nice evening at a small Japanese restaurant the night before our next morning flight. Would stay again."
"The location of the house is pretty good, two stations away from Changi Airport. Around one minute walk from MRT Tanah Merah station to the house.
The room is very tidy and facilities are also complete. This housing estate has a beautiful swimming pool and it__ free.
Kelvin is a nice host. He allowed me to check in before 11 pm.
Sorry to bother him and his family these days. I will book his house next trip to Singapore."
It__ very close to MRT and airport.. 
"I had a pleasant night there and it was real close to the airport and also to the train station that is connected to the airport. 
Everything was nice and clean. Kelvin was a friendly host. My recommendations."
Unfortunately nobody shiwed up when we arrived at the unit. The security tried to help by call the render but not picked up. We were so tired and confused to knock and knock the door caused it was 10 to 11 pm s...still nobody shiwed up.Our worst experience in Spore...a true nightmare for my little child as well
"Kelvin is an amazing host. Very friendly and a positive guy. As mentioned, the apartment is very close to MRT and airport too. The society is nice and have a huge pool.

Anyone who will stay here will like it for sure."
Great location near tanah merah MRT. Pool view from bedroom. So relaxing.
Spacious room and clean
Perfect location and communication was brilliant. Just the room was for 3 people quite small.
"Really great location, easy to get to from airport. Big swimming pool without crowds."
"Kelvin was helpful.. the only disappointment was the check in. 
The place is nice and comfortable but cleanliness needs to be maintained.. specially when the apartment is let out to multiple people during same period. 
Overall, it was a good and comfortable stay."
Near to MRT to airport
"nice flat, nice room, close to the airport and the train(mrt)..perfect for a stopover"
Decent place for 1 night prior to early departure from airport but I wouldn__ recommend staying more than one night. Pool was nice to lay by. Had to meet hosts wife at MRT for check in - would be easier to meet at the building itself. Also check in and check out times are the same so clarify with host if you will be there for 12pm.
very good
recommended
"Super easy quick night between flights! Easy access from airport, Kelvins wife met me and walked me to their place from the train even though my flight was late. Very hospitable!"
"The place is within a private condominium complex near Tanah Merah station, so it is super convenient for those with a connecting flight the next morning. Kelvin provides a step-by-step instruction to get to his place with quick response. The room is as described and everything works as expected."
Thanks you Kelvin for making me feel like home at your apartment. Really close to the airport for someone who needs to make a longer transfer in Singapore.
"We arrived very late at Changi airport, so it was great to have easy self check in. The place itself was clean and nice, but the best part of our stay was swimming in the amazing and huge swimming pool in the morning. There were also some great shops and restaurants nearby. I would highly recommend Kelvin's place!"
Super freundlicher und sehr schneller Kontakt. Wurden persÃ¶nlich an der Haltestelle abgeholt. Lage ist wie beschrieben sehr nah am Flughafen und sehr gut zu erreichen

"Kelvin's flat is in a well-appointed condominium 2 minutes walk to the Singapore metro line. 10 minutes to the airport, and only $2.25 SGD.

Room is comfortable and quiet. No problems with checking late, and great communication. Recommended."
"Clean room near MRT. It was quit, you can use the kitchen and the bog Pool. 
For 1 Night perfekt"
"Kelvin's place is conveniently near the airport. I would suggest Grab (like Uber). Depending on car, it can be as low as $9 SGD but you wait a while for the cheaper rides. Increase  to $12-$16 SGD and you will be happier. Getting back on track...

Kelvin and his wife are very gracious. I arrived really late (almost 2:00 AM) but they stayed up to welcome me into their home. Kelvin responds quickly and communication is excellent!"
Host is friendly. Location is a plus point staying here as can easily access by mrt.

A nice place to stay and is very near to MRT station.
"Quick response 
Helpful host"
"Aaron lied about available amenities, then lied to Airbnb when investigated. I was forced to make a last minute booking somewhere else for my family. Then he has the nerve to leave me a review for a stay which did not happen. Avoid this criminal."
We stayed in this place for 3 nights. The location is not great for touring Singapore as it's far from all main attraction. The place stinks a lot. Unclean bed sheets and towels. Not value for money and master bedroom ac was not working effectively in the heat of summer. The price is not worth the place.
"We spend 1wk+ at Amber & Marco__ apartment. They were extending communicative and helpful.  They were out of town so we did not get to meet them, but everything was very smooth and they were very kind and helpful. The apartment is very nice and comfortable in a central location. We would not hesitate to recommend staying here."
"The place is in a quiet residential area. I believe Dakota is 3 mins by car, but you can always take the bus which is nearby. There is also a hawker center around 10 minutes walk from the place. Its a good idea to contact Aaron and his team before heading to the stay, and they do give fast response."
No further comment but will not choose to stay for next trip
"Our friends and us enjoyed our stay at the Dacota location. Easy access to train, food supplies and lovely restaurant down on the corner. Comfortable beds and great to be able to wash clothes."

"Booked Aaron's apartment after our last booking cancelled on us 1 week before our trip to Singapore. Luckily, Aaron was very responsive, had great communication and easy instructions. Though his apartment had room for improvement (one of the showers was leaking and kitchen is in need of a makeover), the location was good (10 minutes walk to Dakota MRT) with cheap restaurants only a few hundred metres away."
"The amenities provided are great.
The house is big enough for 8 ppl.
I didn't like the location though.
The house was clean and tidy when we arrived. The host was great and checkin was fast."
RC's place is very clean and in a great location.
"Great stay at a clean place! Bed linens were very clean :)
Please provide more toilet paper rolls though."
"Very good location as it is close to Orchard, but still very quiet"
Good place.  Modern decor. Air conditioner worked well.
"I enjoy my stay in RC__ place, the staff (Arif) was super helpful, responsive and friendly, the location is great, walking distance to Killiney road, Orchard road also not far from Clark Quay. The place itself is comfortable, clean with complete amenities. would love to rebook for my next visit."
RC__ place is clean and is per described. Host is helpful and responsive to request too. The room was at the top floor so it was kinda warm in the afternoon as the air con was overwhelmed. Aside from that maybe can add hanging rack or spaces for clothes and towels. Thanks for the pleasant stay.
"Bonne communication mais appartement ne correspondait pas a  nos attentes et aux photos car changement d__ppartement pas demandÃ©. Nous avons eu un appartement au rez de chaussÃ©e sombre , mal odorant, cuisine extÃ©rieur tres chaude et impraticable quand il pleut

"Not much of a complaint. Housekeeper quite rude and unfriendly . When ask if can check out late, he replied a firm NO"
The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

Very good host. Very good room.
"Me and my friends had a wonderful stay at Neha's apartment. Loved the ambience and facilities. The pool was amazing. Walking distance to supermarket, 7E and food court meant that yyou were never left hungry"
"I had stayed in Kaurus' place for around 7 months. I had never stayed anywhere that long before, but I did it for the first time because the place suits my lifestyle. It's near 2 mrt stations, allowing me to travel easily. There are at least 5 food courts nearby (I don't usually eat in an actual restaurant). There hasn't been any problem."

"If you're on budget, not looking for a good service and only wanted to stay for a night, you're looking at Gap Year Hostel.

*Service
It was shit, we waited 10 minutes for the receptionist to attend to us as he went elsewhere during working hour. We had to wait for another 10 minutes for him to slowly figure his shit out while we're just standing there.

Another worker as I recall was chilling on her bed, watching movie across our bed unit during work hour, unbelievable.

*Bed unit
It was alright, for a 5'9"" dude I was able to sit upright with barely enough leg room. The bed and pillow was rather comfy. The ventilation wasn't very good as it gets warm once you completely roll down the shades, so I suggest to leave a bit of opening for the air to flow.

*Cleanliness
Not much to comment on this, it wasn't dirty.

P.S. Shout out to the Malaysian woman who were more helpful than the workers, you're awesome!"
Great location clean and good aircon
"Such a cozy and convinient studio, and so easy to get around! Better than I expected!"

Absolutely wonderful place to stay. I am lucky enough to have a return visit to the excellent place again and will definitely be my first choice. Very comfortable. Will give you like staying in your own house feeling. Host was friendly.

"El apartamento estÃ¡ muy bien ubicado !; la zona es bonita ! Y el apartamento como tal adentro no es feo pero tampoco es como puede llegarse a imaginar por las fotos es igual a las fotos solo que por la posiciÃ³n de la fotos y demÃ¡s puede uno pensar que es muy amplio y algo distinto. 
Tienen muchas reglas solo se puede lavar dos veces !; toca dejar desatendidas las camas !; la chapa de la puerta es con llave si se extravÃ­a cobran un montÃ³n !; no te dejan agua; el tv tiene sÃ³lo dos canales; no te dejan shampo ni nada de eso ! 
En fin es bueno por 3 dÃ­as pero ya 1semana se me hace incomodo !"
Very nice place right in the centre of town. Room was very clean and nice
Very helpful host! Good localisation - close to metro station.
This place are great. With the affordable price and good location position (only 3 minutes to kallang mrt by walking). Makes us can go everyday around the south of spore
"I really enjoy my stay here in this apartment. Everything is in working order and superb clean. The response from the landlord is fast, truthful and as what we expected.

This place is located at The central of Singapore and is accessible to MRT in just few mins walk away. Really save my time travelling around Singapore.

Overall rating is Very Good"
Super host/ Mindy is very caring and kind. Helped me in difficult times.
"First things first, Jay takes special care of his hosts. Very responsive to every inquiry regardless of time and day.  The location is excellent and the studio with weekly housekeeping service is located very near to City Square Mall, Farrer Park MRT Station and Little India. Not to forget to Jalan Besar with very good food choices. The studio is clean, quiet and is well equipped .  I recommend this to anyone who wants to stay for a longer time in Singapore.
Thank you and keep doing a good job."
Was very with my stay
Perfect for 3 months or more
"Great location for restaurants, bars etc. Very clean and secure"
"Great place to stay, clean and a very easy check in."
"The team of Yee, we felt very comfortable within our month stay!  We were taken care of from Check-In to our last day.  The professionalism and the handling fascinated us!  During our visit we forgot the entrance card, a short text message and we were helped further.  You can rely on the Yee team!  The apartment is stylishly furnished and has a large bathroom.  The location is perfect. With the bus in front of the door you drive only 7 minutes to the center.  We recommend it to everyone. Best regards and See you for sure in the Next time - Sanja&Arthur"
Great host and ideal location. Good communication.  Will definitely stay again on my next visit.
"The location is great if your happy going by bus,  the walk to the MRT is 10-15 mins"
"Stayed here for 2 weeks. Check in process was very easy. The place is a few minutes walk from a hawker and next to a few chinese restaurants, but the grocery store, MRT etc are 10-15 minutes walk. There is a bus stop on the opposite side of the airbnb so that is convenient. 

The room was cleaned once a week as part of the rental, but the cleaner could have done a better job on the vacuuming part. I still was able to see dust/crumbs on the floor after she left. Other than that I do not have much to complain about the place. Large windows, curtains that completely darken the bedroom. Just the bed is a bit short. I am 1.75 meters and I barely fit in it. If I was a bit taller my feet would probably be sticking out, something to consider if you are quite tall. 
The airbnb has also its own washer/dryer/drying rack and soap to wash your clothers, so you can save money on laundry by doing it here."
Very nice apartment that has everything you need. A few small issues with the laundry service but the host is on that. Perfect area.
Very nice apartment. There is a bus stop opposite the apartment which is very convenient! The host was so nice and respond to our request quickly. I will definitely book this again if I come to Singapore.
Great apartment - all amenities you would ever need and also one bus ride away from downtown.
Evrrythink was amazing  thanks for  all
Very clean and a new place. Very easy to checkin and checkout. Nearest MRT is 15 min walk but there are  buses nearby going to most places. Bed is nice but abit small for 2 people. Communication is great and all ambitious and services works very well
Never got to stay in that place. Was shipped to another location on the day of my booking. Place alright from the pictures but TV was too old for my devices and had to move out. Not very happy with the way the TV issue was dealt with. The place itself was good and the check-in process as well. If believe that under regular circumstances I would have been very happy with my stay.
"A clean, conveniently located apartment near Tiong Bahru. Newly renovated, it made a great base for my business trip. The staff were very helpful, and I__l definitely consider staying again."
Great for long-term stay. Good location and operations team was very responsive. We would stay here again!
Good value for money. Nice location close to city center. Good supermarket within walking distance - you get everything you need there. For those who want serious cooking: please note there are no oven and dishwasher. Fully recommend this place and the owner.
Easy check in. Good location. Efficient communication. Good long stay overall.
"It was a comfortable stay.
Location is good, apartment is clean and tidy, host is always available.
Convenient check in and check out. 
The bed is very comfortable as well.
I__l definitely book again.
Thank you."
"We stayed at Yee's place for our first month in SG. Being at this accommodation and location really helped settle us into SG perfectly. 
Yee and his team were always on point in responding to all our queries throughout our stay. The apartment is also super spacious, clean and modern and so was a pleasure to stay in. Actually felt like home they even supply basic utensils dishes and cutlery, kettle, Microwave washing machine etc which I loved. 

I would definitely recommend staying at the Outram location Its perfect for everything. Got a F45 (workout) right next door which was brilliant and awesome bar called Vibes Bar 5 steps away which was great too have close by too. Station is only 5 min walk from the Apartment which was brilliant for me too.

All in all perfect no complaints what so ever! :)"
"Very accommodating host with great response time. Area was clean, neat, and very close to a large number of interesting Singaporean neighborhoods and shopping areas. Would highly recommend!"
The apartment is modern and conveniently located in a great neighborhood near the Tiong Bahru hawker center and half way between two MRT stations & near bus lines.   The host was responsive and accommodating.  Thanks!
Well located home with excellent food options and nearby amenities. Place is very well maintained by a superb team.
The room is very clean and daily amenities are all available to use. The housekeeper will clean and disinfect the floor once a week. The hosts are easy to communicate and responsive for whatever questions. The guidance is clear and check in process very smooth. The room is next to street so a bit noisy at night and host sent me earbuds to secure a peaceful sleep for me. Very appreciated for the hosting.
"Great place,value for money. Very convenient location. The space is clean, check in and out was a breeze. Host was responsive and checked in with us to see if we had any issues. Highly recommended!"
"Great location and stylish suite around the corner from the heritage district of Tiong Bahru complete with lively cafÃ©s, bakeries, food market and walking spots. Very clean and well appointed, with very friendly prompt service from the customer service team."
"Great amenities and modern interior. Friendly and helpful staff: check-in is smooth, communication is fast. Great location in Tiong Bahru, just 2 minutes away from the hawker Center."
"Good layout, wonderful location with lots of good food in the area"
Very cosy place and nice host!
very nice
"The place is like what it is shown in the photos, I love the toilet and shower because it__ spacious. New hand soap and shampoos were provided during my long stay ;) 
Have some issue with the aircon but already feedback to them and hope they can be more aware of the issue before someone move in next time.
This room in located right next to the street and the window is not really a soundproof type. Take note if you are light sleeper.
I highly recommend this room for solo or couple traveler ;)"
Well done with everything. Thank you
Nice cosy place with cleanliness in mind .
The interior design and all the organising with the self check in and the placement of things in the flat were very thoughtful and useful! I would definitely come back soon and I recommend this place a 10/10.
Thank you for the nice stay. Efficient check in and check out process. Will visit again.
"Jay, Yee & Nicholas were absolutely amazing hosts, very prompt with queries. Definitely will recommend if you__e looking for a quiet stay. Location wise it was perfect and to cap it off the place was comfortable and clean."
Apartment is great and check-in was easy. Team is very responsive to resolve any queries too. Highly recommended!
"The location and the basic amenities of this space are ok, albeit the noise from the Panda food outlet straight below can be annoying. However, it is a 'space' not a 'destination'."
"Bad experiment
Book at Your own risk"
Location is very good being 5 min walk from Tiong Bahru estate and market. Bus down to Chinatown in 5 min. Light sleeper will find room next to traffic disturbing for sleep. Host communicates actively and is very responsive. Otherwise room is clean and well maintained like advertised. Our experience was sub-optimum because neighbour were smoking and cigarette smell seeps into room. However host was responsive and took action quickly so that made up for it.
Amazing place at a great location. Everythings provided and host us helpful and prompt. Highly recommended
Overall great place to stay for its location and good sized apartment. Shower pressure is really good! Nicholas is a star for his customer service and would recommend people to come stay at this apartment. Just a small disclaimer: Foodpanda motorists downstairs can get a little annoying so come prepared with earplugs and you will be fine. Five stars!
"This place is ready close to Tiong Bahru food market! Also very close to outram park or Tiong Bahru station. It also has several bus stations around so very convenient to go around the city. 

The only little thing will be it__ right next to a delivery center so it will sometimes be noisy at night.

Everything else is great and highly recommend!"
Great location and really cozy place to stay in!
"Cosy and nicely done up place! Great location near cafes, restaurants, and bars"
"This apartment is exactly what I needed for my trip to care for my mom.  The location is ideal.

It is as listed and comfortable for my need.  As it is near the main road, it can be a little noisy if you are sensitive to noise.  I am used to sleeping with ear plugs, so I slept pretty well.

Nicholas and the Yee/Jay team are amazing.  They are extremely helpful and constantly in contact with any questions or requests."
Fully furnished like a home 
"The apartment is newly renovated & has everything a individual or couple would need for a short term or extended stay.  It is well located with lot of restautant + cafe choices in the near vicinity.  Also a short wallk to the Tiong Bahru Market + Tiong Bahru Mall.  Close to transport (MRT + Bus), however limited on-street parking, so probably not very suitable if you are driving.  Couple of down sides;  1) Very limited TV choice - installing one of the Singapore internet TV options (StsrHub or Singtel) would greatly improve choices.  2) There is a Food Panda kitchen / pick-up located in the shoplots on the ground floor.  This results in large number of delivery riders coming / going & hanging around outside the apartment.  The delivery kitchen also generates a huge amount of garbage which often overflows the bins that are provided & is then left laying around on the footpath."
"The room was cosy and perfect for couples. Access is straight forward, nearby bus stops and mrt stations, so getting around is a breeze. It can be a little difficult for light sleepers as it__ close to the main road, so there__ quite some traffic noise at times."
"Cosy place to stay. Felt safe. Very comfortable, felt like home."
"Newly renovated, modern look yet cozy experience during my stay. A lot of restaurants  & cafe to choose around the area. Very accessible in going to central and other parts of SG."
Very tidy and lovely_this_apartment equipped with everything you need. A good bed and nice bathroom. We had a great stay!
The host is really helpful!
"This was a truly unique and comfortable experience. The Hmlet is a community focussed co-living that offers a range of amenities that a standard Airbnb or even a hotel lacks. 

I spent a week there working, doing meetings and feeling super productive in an inspiring place, I would recommend this to anyone traveling for work or even for leisure."
"I recently spent a week in Hmlet Cantonment and it exceeded all my expectations. Amazing facilities, beautiful rooms, super friendly and helpful staff, lots of co-living spaces including kitchen, laundry, hangout spaces (indoor and outdoor). It__ also in a great location and close to 2 MRT stations. This is now my top choice of accommodation in Singapore and I have no hesitation in recommending it you anyone reading this review."
"Definitely a great alternative than a hotel! The place is located in a great area to walk around and walking distance to 2 MRTs, Fairprice, fairprice finest and cold storage. There's no better area to be, and Hmlet Cantonment is filled with great personalities who are more than willing to stop what they're doing for a quick chat and help you out."
"My stay at Hmlet was lovely! Checking in was a breeze and the Hmlet staff were always very helpful and friendly.  My room was stylish, cozy, and clean. The bed was super comfortable. Hmlet is located roughly a 10 minute walk to central CBD and to all the cozy bars and restaurants in Chinatown. I highly recommend staying at Hmlet Cantonment."
Great apart hotel. Check in hosts at reception are very attentive and helpful.
"Great location close to supermarket, restaurants, mall and hawker stalls. The extra large studio was a bit smaller than I had expected but the pictures are definitely accurate, just taken from a clever angle. The unit was very clean and there was even water, coffee and beer provided in the communal kitchen."
"Hmlet Cantonment was an excellent place to stay. It's been very well renovated with excellent usable spaces both inside and outside. Location-wise, it was a short walk from two MRT stations and also close to areas that are great for walking and eating such as Maxwell and Chinatown.

We highly recommend it."

"Visited with family and we love the place. Wonderful staff, great location and great facilities. Perfect for long stays, where you need to feel at home... we highly recommend and we will be back soon for more :)"
"Really nice place. A few oddities about the setup (e.g., no plug for a hair dryer in the bathroom or near a mirror?), but the space is modern, clean, and well-located. On top of that, everyone is extremely helpful and they were quick to respond when I needed them.  They have a wonderful community canteen, where there are complimentary coffee, water, and beer, as well as a nice fitness studio that I took advantage of every day. Overall, I'm pleased with my stay!"
Super nice place. Highly recommended!
"Hmlet Cantonment is well placed as it__ in the town area, about 7 mins walk away from the metro and surrounded by many restaurants. The staff are the most accommodating people i have come across. They assisted us without hesitation every single time. We stayed in the large room which had all the advertised amenities. We will definitely return here!"
"Lovely place, great staff, terrific location."
"Wonderful place, great staff, superb location! Highly recommended, superb for long stays."
Definitely a place to stay while adventuring Singapore. It__ in the middle of everything!!
"Place is nice maybe I excpected bigger room! 
Staff is very friendly and helpfull I could give 5stars for that!
I would like to cleaner garden area and next to pool!"
"Awesome place. Very clean. Close to MRTs, Bus Stops. Would love to come back here again."
"We had a pleasant stay at Hmlet. A nice a spacious room.  Generally very well kept. Good indoor and outdoor communal areas.
Helpful employees."
"è¿__æ¯___¹ä¾¿_,å¤§å_½æ_è¾___,å¾__è°!"
"Loved the stay here. Location is very central and you could get anywhere in Singapore within 15 mins by taxi. Some are walkable from there (Raffles,  Chinatown etc). Rooms are quite nice though we expected the extra large rooms would be bigger as seen in the pics - but no complains. There is one beautiful outdoor space (common for everyone) where you could just relax and chill. Pool is quite small though. Staffs are friendly and helpful."
"Great space with stylish and comfortable furnishings and very friendly staff. The location was great, close to two MRT stations but also quiet at night."
"Would Highly recommend this place. Very private, easy to get to everything. Staff is very Helpful. Everything is new, smells and looks great. Can't stress enough how helpful the staff was to me. Thank you so to your staff, and hope to see you in the near future."
"This hotel is a fine place to stay when you__e in town. The furnishings are modern and nice, the staff is really friendly, and the community rooms with coffee available any time are a great benefit for a jet lagged traveler. It__ a bit __ut of the way,_ with no convenient MRT stations or hawker centers around the corner like some of the other places I__e stayed, but it__ clean, quiet, and pretty, so I__ not complaining."
"Fantastic location, modern and clean furnishings, extremely friendly staff and great service.. Would recommend for anyone wanting hassle free quality accommodation!"

"Not as clean as is expected of a listing at this price. Not that accessible either, but is good distance from 7/11 and whampoa market."
Space was nice and clean but it wasn__ as accessible as i thought it would be
"The coordination between the housekeeper and owner sucks. The key is with the housekeeper and I didn__ expect that the housekeeper will be 3km away from the premises. He asked me to take grab to the location of the housekeeper, I talked to the housekeeper and he asked for tips if I wanted him to come to the place to pass the key to me. Owner was given me such a sarcastic tone saying _ nvm la, 10 dollars I have I can give _ so you think I don__ have the 10dollars ? From 2BR then last minute ask if we can change to another room 1BR and refunded 9dollars only!!! Seriously 1BR only cost SGD9?!!!
Highly not recommended if you are looking for short vacation, btw the housekeeper is rude also, same pattern as the owner, mood spoilt !!!!! Strongly not suggested if you are looking for happier Homestay."
"This place is a sure thing.  It is very clean, new, and everything works perfectly.  There is a nice view from the balcony, and the building has a great pool.  It's a short walk to the MRT (with some air conditioning too if you cut through City Square Mall), and there are tons of nearby restaurants.  Great customer service too!"
cool spot very central
"Mark and Jane became a second family for me during these times of lockdown and restrictions. They belong to the nicest people I have ever met in my life and I am very thankful that I could enjoy my time in Singapore with and because of them. I can only recommend a stay in their house, as I never felt like I was missing anything."
Very nice landlord. Nice location and near everything. View is awesome since it is in high floor
"Excellent location, great response by helpful host."
"Nice flat in a very convenient area, with restaurants,gym and shopping malls around"
"Safe and good location for grocery shopping,transportation and restraurant nearby.Easy check-in/out and condition as online described.But internal facilities i.e. bath towel,bed sheet need to be renewed or improved. Strong and pungent odor was found in storage room,Please spend some time to improve."
"Decent quality hotel in a great location, very very easy to get to wherever you want to go in the city via MRT. Room was nice and mostly clean, beds were comfortable. The main issue was that there was no hot water at night when taking a shower, past 11pm and even around 10am the next morning. This happened multiple nights. Not sure if it was my room only or building wide. 

Aside from that it was good for the price and a comfortable place to return after exploring hot and humid Singapore"
"Very value for money, everything you would require out of a small studio"
Good place. Quite small but good spot
Very small space but comfortable and very clean.
"Overall experience is good, just a pity for the bad attitude of one of the ladies at the front desk."
"nice stay, I always book this place for my weekends in Singapore."
Always a nice stay at RedDoorz
"Amazing stay, clean and in a good position to visit the city. Highly recommended"

"The Hmlet is a fantastic place to stay for travelers, even those with Children.  Staff are extremely friendly, accommodating and understanding.  They went out of their way to help my wife and our daughter.  They went out of their way to help my wife when the stroller broke down and my wife needed assistance with our daughter.  Because of the broken stroller, they were extremely understanding and helped with a late check out so our daughter could take her usual nap.  The pricing of the laundromat in house is also reasonably and efficient.  The place is alway kept sparkling clean even with regular usage of the kitchen and canteen.  All the staff are very friendly, including the cleaning crew and security.  We will definitely stay here again.  An extremely pleasant and awesome experience."
good value
Great location very accessible and cute staff always smiling and welcoming.
"My sister and Ioved staying at Hmlet! The amazing amenities and the cleanliness of the place were the things that we loved the most. Staff were always friendly (well except one, this is me being picky!). Other than that, perfect stay! The communal kitchen is very handy, you can buy food and store it in the fridge. Free tea and coffee.
Overall, I think this place can suit everyone, solo traveler, group, couple and family!"
"Nice, quiet stay in a convenient, newly renovated historic building. Friendly staff, comfortably modern common area, and craft beer on tap! Located a short walk from Maxwell food center and central Singapore. Thoroughly enjoyed the stay."
"Expect good service, ammenities and facilities. 5/5 will visit again."
I've stayed at $500 a night hotels that didn't have staff that was attentive as the Hmlet staff. Above and beyond. Can't recommend enough.
"Loved our time at Hmlet Cantonment. Co-living is an amazing concept, and the communal spaces were beautifully made to comfort multiple groups of people at the same time. The rooms were light and clean (the bathrooms are stunning), the outdoor areas are really cozy, the kitchens are beautiful. We also really loved the location as it's close to the MRT, near some really good restaurants and a couple of stations away from Sentosa Island. Huge thanks to the amazing staff at Hmlet Cantonment too, such polite and helpful people are a blessing. Thank you for our stay!"
"What an amazing place ! My partner and I spent 8 days in Singapore and Hmlet was in the perfect location! Easy access to shops and trains. Amazing amenities, absolutely loved the shared spaces! The room was fantastic and the decor through the whole place set such a great vibe! All staff we amazing and couldn__ have been more helpful. We look forward to coming back and staying at Hmlet again !"
Great spot
"Highly recommend, it's super clean and great location, super nice host."
"The place is super clean, great location and very stylish place, much much better than I expected. The staff really helped a lot during circuit breaker time."
The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
The room is nice but it on lever 4 and you have to climb without lift.
Value for Money
Though the place i stayed wasn't the the one i booked. The host was kind enough to arrange a good place that met my needs. Overall hassle free place to stay for a long duration.
"This is an excellent place to stay from the point of view of convenience and comfort. Very neat and clean, good styling, safe and value for money. Will definitely be looking this place up first if staying in Singapore."

"Affordable, value for money serviced apartment. What I really like about this place is that it is always clean. Another plus point is its proximity to the malls and MRT stations (about 5-7 minutes' walk/400m). Breakfast is provided on weekdays which I usually will collect at Level 1 before I leave for work. Kitchenette is well-equipped and laundry detergent is also provided."
Wow! Yeah! Oh yeah! Amazing! Super! Great time!
Everything was good
Good value for money.
"Fabulous apartment in an outstanding complex close to all amenities and transport, loved every moment of our stay. Host easy to deal with, highly recommend we__l be back "
Great place
"The location is quite good, lot of services nearby: mrt, foodcourt, super market, library, etc.."
Overall is ok.
Excellent location. Close to subway & shops & food options. Easy walk to the marina.
As advertised. Great location.
Tanya's place as described matches 100% to the expectations. It was great to come back to the clean and nice space after the day's tiredness. There was also a small handmade map that was kept there which was very helpful. I highly recommend the place.
"Great homely place to stay with family. Location is perfect for and some of the places like National Museum, Little India, Bugis, Clark St are at walking distance. All amenities in place and perfect."
"Very nice appartement, so comfortable and very easy to go shopping"
Great location and very clean.  The host was quick to respond when we messaged. The beds were uncomfortable but we enjoyed our stay in Singapore nonetheless.
"Tanya's place is so ideal for travelling in Singapore, it is close to everything you need. The place is clean, space is good, amenities are good, AC is great and everything was so smooth. I would definitely come back again."
Ok good
The entire apartment is very clean and has a great location. The facilities are in great condition and I highly recommend traveller with family can pick this place during their visit to Singaporeï½
"Great Locations, suitable for group visitors"
"Absolutely perfect location. We intended to buy tourist bus passes but no need as we walked to Orchard Road, Raffles, Gardens by the Bay museums. There are several great restaurants 5 to 10 minutes from our door. 
Our host called us on our way to the airport with clear arrival instructions and an introduction to Mark who greeted us promptly on arrival and helped us enter. He gave a full tour of the unit with friendly humour and patience with our questions. 
The unit is spacious. The 2 modern washrooms with showers and separate tubs have good hot water with lots of pressure. 
The unit has excellent a/c and wifi and is sparking clean. My bare feet were happy. 
Loved the street views from our 10th floor windows. 
Definitely a place to return to."
Generally satisfactory.
"This apartment is as advertised, clean, comfortable , the location is great and Mr Chua,  Tanya's Friend, is also very helpful.
I would definitely recommend Tanya's  place to stay in Singapore."
Good location and a nice place to stay near public transit.
"We really enjoyed staying in this apartment. 

The apartment was very clean. Nice view and fantastic location. 

Good communication with Tanya and Mark who checked us in was very kind. He even brought us some Chinese New Years oranges. 

We had booked two separate stays for beginning and end of our trip. We are looking forward to coming back to stay at Tanya__ apartment in a few weeks."
Location of the rental is good. Cleanliness is less than stellar
"You 'll get the great place at singapore. Near orchard,MRT,bus station. This place is recommended"
"Good location, good host, very helpful. Clean and comfortable to stay in. Near Mrt stations so it was easy for us to travel around. Quite a variety of food nearby. And a lot of convenience store as well. Good stay good stay!"

Location is good and convenient.
"Very close to Downtown line and bus stop. The house is clean and relaxable.

"Clean,tidy,good location.Highly recommend for family"
We enjoyed our second stay. The apartment is well stocked and in a fantastic location. Smooth check in with the lovely Mark. Highly recommend.
Really nice place
"As advertise, minus the wifi."

Great Place. Easy Self-Check In. Recommended place for staycation gateway for couple. Awesome!!
Nice clean place for a short local getaway.
"The place has some unpleasant smell. Quite good value but if you do not drive, it only have one bus stop in front of the place and walk 15 min to the nearest mrt."
Terrible experience post checkout. Dishonest host. They provided us a very old damaged washer and when I noticed during 1st use reported immediately and they recognised as 'Noted'. Now to be more surprised after checkout suddenly demanded 480SGD mentioning detergent cabinet broken. Not recommended to stay..
"We enjoyed our stay so much at Belle and Jean's place. From the start, Jean was super responsive to our request and kept her deal and word when we requested for her to keep the place available for a few hours, at a given rate. Our two week plus stay was perfect. The kitchen is fully equipped and we could buy groceries quickly from Food Joy underneath, given the Circuit Breaker period we were under. The living space and bedroom were wonderful places to work and sleep at, with the air-conditioner working perfectly well. The Wi-Fi is extremely fast, and the shower was good. We even had access to two toilets - one in the bedroom area, and one in the kitchen! I highly recommend this place for the large amount of space, cleanliness, quick responses, and the highly stylish touch. Thank you so much Belle and Jean! We will come back again for a longer stay."
this is a good place ! I will recommend this place to my friends when they visit Singapore !
Very accurate as shown in the lsiting
the staff are very friendly and helpful. 24hour check in was a big plus.
"Hmlet Cantonment is in a great location, very close to bus stops and within a 10min walk to the nearest MRT. The 24hour staff are always very friendly and helpful. The communal space was great, very stylish, air conditioned and with free teas and coffees on tap. The room was lovely and the shower great. The only negative is that our room wasn__ made up everyday like a hotel, but it certainly wouldn__ stop us staying there again."
"I was in Singapore for a month for business and Hmlet was a great choice. The room was private, clean and easy to access. Hmlet offered a great in person staff that was incredibly friendly, helpful and genuinely interested in the lives of their guests. Having spent many evenings working from the cantina, it was always pleasant to grab a coffee or a snack and have a chat with those that were working that evening. If I find myself in Singapore again, I wouldn't mind spending some time at the Hmlet again!"
"Clean place and very nice staff, always available to provide assistance"
Highly recommended
"A very clean and comfortable place, located within walking distance from Chinatown. Would recommend!"
"Had a great stay at Hmlet cantonment, the room was new and clean and the amenities were great along with the coworking space, would definitely stay there again!"
"I had a lovely stay. Staff is super kind and always ready to help. Location is good, close to shops and supermarkets and 10 minutes walk to the bars and restaurants around Club street."
everything is good.
"Location is superb. Room and facilities are clean, tidy and stylish. 
As my room was next to the street, there were audible vehicle noises during day time but not unbearably loud. 
The bedding and mattress is average comfort and the bed frames feels a bit weak and squeaky but forgivable given the room price at the great location. 
Overall we had a pleasant stay despite some forgivable misses."
"Great green space in the close proximity to the CBD. Great team of helpful people always there to support, feels like a vibrant community always with the sleekness of a hotel room plus equal warmth of a huge living room style hang out area, where one can spend loads of time. Highly recommend."
Fantastic place! We loved our stay here. The staff was very kind and the facilities are so good.
"Great location, love the common area with the lights at night. Rooms are clean and brand new, although slightly small. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Overall,  great place to stay for a week."
"Magic place, everything is new and clean, helpfull stuff!  They try to do your rest carefree. We arrived very early and were tired, but they found for us the room for the early check-in. We used kitchen for cooking the food, the pool outside and attended yoga classes. There was free tea, _offee, beer and treats.
There is good wifi and the working zone in the canteen, it was important for our working. We like this place limitlessly. Many great things were not mentioned here :)
Thank you for the good time at your aparthotel. You are topnotch, guys_"
Nice and neat.
"Thank you to the team at Hmlet Cantonment! Super helpful in getting me situated, helping me find a local vegan restaurant, sharing which taxi app to download-the staff there 24 hours a day were so kind and ready to help with directions or suggestions. 

The property is beautiful, brand new and stylish- the free coffee and beer were awesome. 

The common areas were a great place to get some work done on my laptop, and even had a yoga studio on premise with classes or just go in when there__ not a class and use on your own. 

Can__ wait to come back for vacation since I was there for work and hope to explore the area more."
"Good location for a stay in Singapore, easy to reach by public transport. Very clean and relaxed shared areas, coffee and tea for free. We enjoyed the small pool as well.  Self laundry service is provided, really convenient. There are good yoga classes nearly every day, really comfortable to just get up in the morning and do yoga in the same building. Nice, friendly and helpful staff."
"Perfect place, especially for what we needed. Great location for exploring Singapore. The staff were incredibly courteous and ready to help. 24-7 check-in was very convenient, and the free beer was a nice touch!"
"Clean Room, very nice and helpful crews. It's close to downtown and famous places (actually Singapore is small, so, haha). The only drawback is my room is a bit noisy in the morning due to the traffic outside."

"Hmlet is a great home for a stay in Singapore - short or long term. We loved our stay, the stylish room, the friendly and helpful desk and caretaking staff and the amenities/common areas. Highly recommended."
"Excellent stay, the room was clean and cosy. Very good location and amenities. I'd recommend"
"Super clean, had a lovely stay
Amazing staff so helpful at all times.
Location is great much recommended!!"
"This was definitely a great experience compared to other Airbnb experiences I've had. It's a friendlier and approachable atmosphere compared to hotels, but that doesn't mean the accommodations weren't great either. The place itself had great interior design, and the staff were all super friendly and efficient in checking us in and out. Shoutout to staff member Chris for going the extra mile: he not only welcomed us with a smooth checking in experience, but he would also approach me and my boyfriend to chat whenever we would chill at the canteen area, and that's a unique experience we'll never forget! Overall accommodations were super clean and comfortable (including a flatscreen TV with Netflix!), only small complaint I have is that our shower area was open door so it's quite easy to make a mess. Definitely recommend to people looking for a hassle-free experience while travelling in SG or looking for a staycation!"
Friendly staff and clean rooms! You can bring a few friends over to chill at the communal area. Superb location.
"You had me at beer on tap! But besides that the whole experience staying at Hmlet Cantonment was fantastic. Clean and stylish room, amazing facilities in a great location with friendly staff. Cannot ask for more!"
It was a fantastic stay! The concept is so great and the complimentary Coffee and beer is a nice touch! If I must stay at Singapore I would stay at Hmlet! The Hmlet Crew were so friendly and easy! Well Done!
"Wonderful staff, great place all n all!"
"Great experience at Hmlet Cantonment. The hotel had amenities like an outdoor pool, communal kitchens which were well stocked with pans and cutlery, and a laundry room. The staff were really friendly. 
The room was small but comfortable, and I really liked the modern design. Most of all, we really enjoyed that the tv had Netflix. 
Housekeeping tidies the room once every 3 days. Recommended, will return"
"Place was really good, would love to visit again, have experienced wonderful hospitality by staff over there..."
"This place is great ! Location is really central, recent renovation and very friendly. Do not hesitate to book."
Very stylish hotel with great working lobby. Like a WeWork. Same vibe and amenities :-) Central location.
Fantastisk hotel pg personale
"Great place! the staff are incredibly helpful, The room is quite small but the other common areas available make up for that."

"Place was clean and in a great location, and staff was very friendly and helpful. Will definitely stay again!"
Overall meets the expectations of what you would see in the photos and description. The minimum night stay requirement feels a little too much. I__ personally in town a week at a time occasionally and would happily do 3 or 4 nights if available. Staff are pleasant and welcoming. Rooms and public areas are cleaned for the most part. The communal kitchen in block A can get very hard to move around in with even 2 other people. Location is excellent. Price is about right. Noise from hallway is quite low. Overall a solid stay.
Location is the best. Staff goes out of the way to make you feel comfortable. Would definitely come back.
"We really enjoyed our stay at Hmlet. It is conveniently located just a few steps away from a bus and metro station which takes you to the Marina Bay Area in  not more than 10 minutes. Chinatown was even just an easy 10mins walk by foot away.
The room was sparkling clean and looked just like pictured on the internet. All the necessary amenities were provided and the stuff was super friendly and helpful as well. We__ happily stay here again!"
nice place to live in!will come again!
"Fantastic place to stay. Great staff, ideal location and an amazing space."
Very nice and clean accommodation. Best location and super modern interior. The self catering facilities were incredible
Nice place!!! Thank you very much!!! Excellent and very very clean everywhere places))) Look like co-living with excellent courtyard and open and light coworking. Friendly and caring crews.
"Good location, great customer service - would recommend anyone here on long-term stay to choose Hmlet!"
"Nearest MRT station is 10~15mins away and Bus stops are just 3~5mins so it's very convenient place wherever you go.
Perfect accommodation."
"Way better than I expected, really love this place,the location is great, the place is very clean. Highly recommend!"
Lovely host. Great to organise with her.
"Ted and his helper have been extremely helpful throughout my stay in the property.  It was a month stay, and the apartment provided plenty for my need.  It was adequately furnished, and clearly has been newly refurbished. 

Ted is very communicative, and responds quickly to requests and issues.  The apartment is very well located to the market place which is barely 5 min walk away."
"Jay__ apartment far exceeded my expectations. Jay is a great host. He responded very fast to my messages. The apartment is in a nice location, around 5 mins walk to the MRT and is a short walk to supermarket and small eateries. The place is kept super clean and provides once a week housekeeping services. Cooking is not a problem as the apartment comes with a well equipped kitchen. The place had everything I had hoped for. Thanks Team Jay. Keep it up !"
Good location but not really set up for a group of 4 or more
"Clean place, smooth checkin, fast response by host, place is perfect for 6 adults."
"In general evaluation the pace is okey, only one thing need to upgrade is the Internet connection and also provide even small TV set, the host promised to deliver the TV set and make repair of the Internet connection, we follow up many times but was not materialized until we check out, tahnsk anyways...

Fantastic host!! Requested for a spare set of key and self deliver the next day. Room was spacious and modern. All in all a pleasant stay for a five days staycation near town areas.

Very pleasant host. Quick response to our questions.
Staff there is very nice and very helpful throughout the entire stay. Special thanks to Wee who has been taken great care of us. The place is next to the shopping mall and quite convenient.
Good place to stay for short term.
nice experienced!!
Good for a short stay. Philip shot a video to show me how to open door. But little things were amiss. Mattress was lumpy. Blanket was a throw.  There were no towels available. There was no one at home when I arrived. There's no toilet paper either. The room is in a HDB flat which Philip should have stated in his listing. Bus stops right outside block. The price is good but I'd pay a little more next time and stay in a hotel. I left as early as I could as I couldn't shower (no towel).
"Phillip's place is nice, clean and comfortable.  There is a common kitchen and laundry area to be shared with other users.  It is easily accessible by bus.  It was nice that the host immediately replied to questions via (Hidden by Airbnb) ."
friendly house owner
Phillip was very kind for allowing us to check in early despite last minute booking on that day itself. He replied to my queries very quick and the check in process was so convenient. His place is sparkling clean specially the room. The bed was comfortable and fan and aircon were working good. Bus stop just under the block going to serangoon and amk mrt. Mall was also nearby. Good value! Highly recommended host! Thank you Phillip!
"What a lovely place with affordable price. Philip is great host, very kind, fast respon.
The room__ picture is real.

I love stay at this place "
Phillip'place is accessible to all amenities.
Great hospitality & clean place to stay at _ºï_
Overall is good.
A simple basic place to stayover at!
Phillip place is quite nice! Room is spacious with aircon. Toilet is very clean; towels are provided. We had a good conversation with each other. Thank you Phillip
Thanks for hosting again

Very accomodating and flexible.
The host are very nice  room is clean and big enough. Recommend for whoever bring a family holiday to Singapore and looking for bugdet room.

"Amy is a very nice host. I think she is new to the whole AirBnB scene but she is responsive and will accommodate so just stay in touch with her and be patient/understanding.

The space is nice and compact. Good for parents plus 1 child as you__l need to share the bathroom and there are 2 entrances to it. So not recommended for friends travelling together where you may both need the bathroom at the same time after a night on the town.

There__ also the gym and swimming pool downstairs which are very nice and new.

The space is perfect if you just need a place to sleep and do a few basic things like your laundry and breakfast. Lots of power points for heavy mobile phone users. TV channel selections are also good for English speakers.

I__ recommend staying here"

"Anie is a very good host, she is very helpful when I had problems."
"Quiet neighborhood, easy to find location, friendly host."
"Nice staying in Anie, house"
"The room is good for sleeping only. There__ no chair or table to sit or keep the necessities. 
There__ no closet that you can use. 
There__ not much place to visit around apart from the zoo and the place is a bit far from the city (more than 1.5hr from the city)"
"Annie's place is great! Modern decor and amenities, very accessible by public transport to anywhere. Anie herself is a great host, making sure that her guests are okay and made me feel like home. Highly recommend. :)"
"This place is definitely worth the money! It__ so clean, cozy, and with good facilities.Anie and Adi are both very nice and hospitable hosts. I really enjoyed my stay at their home. Highly recommend Anie and Adi__ place!"
Place was really clean and nice. Walking distance to mrt. Really worth the money.
"It was a great stay at Anie__ place, the room and toilet is very clean."
"The property is nice and cozy. It's a really good place to relax after a long day of working or travelling. The room is spacoius, the view is 5 stars, and the amenities (iron, bathroom, drinks, etc) are all all well prepared. 

It is located in the north, which is a 40 minutes journey to the city by train. If travelling is not a problem for you, then yes, I highly recommend! "
"It__ a quiet and clean place, and Anie is a great host, fast respond and give me a lot of advice."
Great place and hosts! I would happily to stay at the place again.
"The hosts were lovely people and their place surpassed my expectations - clean, tidy, convenient. I would definitely stay there again if I have the chance. The only __ad_ thing is that now my expectations for AirBnB rooms are much higher!"
"The place is cozy, the host is accommodating and nice."
Great host..would definately recommend if you want a nice and quite place..just note that it in not in downtown city...i have something to do in woodland area..Its just 10 mins walk from admiralty mrt (Website hidden by Airbnb) mom goes to the city and says that its quite convenient from our place..around 1 hour trip
"A best airbnb ever, kind owner, helpful, we was check in so much late that we expected, but owner still waiting for us! Thank you so much of taking care of my bf's mum. And simple but good breakfast! Value for money! And nice and super clean room!llll Definitely will book again this wonderful room with no doubt! Thank you again for everything! _¤ï__¤ï__¤ï__¤ï__¤ï__¤ï__¤ï__¤ï_Better than a five star hotel!"
Fantastic place to put up and great hospitality. It was a very last minute arrangement for me in the evening to desperately find a place to put up and the fast response and hospitality really helped. Thank you
Great place to stay and I'm sure will not disappointed you.
"Very friendly and hospitable host. Chill and easy going, very homely feels"
It's a cozy place to stay!
"Very nice place, room is clean and full of amenities. Location is convenient too even though it__ a lil far from the city area but you can get a bus / mrt quite easily. Definitely enjoyed my stay with them :)"
Good place and good location close to MRT station
Great place & people. Thanks Anie.
Very clean quite and spacious place. Highly recommended! Great and responsive host too
"Since we were visiting friends in Admiralty area, the location was perfect.  Near the MRT and near our friends' flat.  From this location, it takes about 45 to 60 minutes to get into center city, depending on final destination.  But for activities in the Woodlands area, location is great.  Nice, big apartment with really excellent common areas.  Very comfortable."
Little oasis in Singapore. Around 45 min journey by the train to the centre but place is so nice that definitely worth to travel slightly longer. Anie was really nice and replied quickly to all messages. Would definitely go back.
"Its a nice and clean place it will make u feel like ur home 
Only a bit far from the city other then its a perfect place"
"Die Lage war super und das Zimmer hatte alles, was man braucht! Au_erdem sehr sauber"
"Wir sind noch eine Nacht geblieben, weil es so gut war"
"Very great and nice appartmen, recomended for tourist"
Convenient location
"Good for a short stay as the room does not have any space for opened suitcases. 
Convenient to public transport. 
Some local eateries near by. 
The welcome was good and efficient."
"Decent location 10 minutes from Fort Canning MRT. Quite budget furnishings, towels did not look clean. Room quite small. Bathroom clean. Apartment complex is a bit like a rat__ warren and you can hear anyone passing by outside. Would expect a bit better for the price"
Great location. We ended up buying the 72 hour pass in Singapore. Bused around and used the MRT system. Great location and great price.
"Small rooms I expected, but the place is a maze of corridors and stairs. Makes you worry about fire exits."
Don__ expect too much
"It's about 10 minutes walk to Somerset station. The room is VERY small, literally I couldn't open my luggage properly in the room, basically no space at all except on the bed."
"_______,å¹²å__´æ_"
Nice location with bus stop just in front of the door and downtown line near by. The staff was very helpful and let us keep our luggage in the hall after check out.
"Great place to stay! Super clean and well kept, bed was very comfy and big smart tv in the room. Bathroom was also very clean and pleasant. Room was small but was big enough for the two of us."
"Great location and clean space with modern interior, at great pricing, room as expected is small. However we did noticed some lizard shit on the bed sheets below the blanket. It didn't bother us as we didn't see any lizards in premises."
Convenient place outdoor bus stop
Excellent! Thanks
Clean and good location. recommended
Good
"The place is very small but modern and clean. Very good location, close to metro (750 meters) and a bus stop just in front of the building. The price is ok for super expensive city but the neighborhood is super laud there were parties everyday and we didnt get much sleep."
"Eine super Unterkunft, sehr zentral gelegen!"
Ongs accommodation was very small for 2 persons. It was a quiet area.
I have stayed here so many times I am practically furniture
"The place was just nice. However, communication platform between host, cleaner and guest can be improve."
"Pat is a very nice and responsive host. She will always provide you a very fast reply and response to the question that you raised. 
Even through some little problem, but pat solved in a very short period of time. Thank you for that. 
Very good location, walking distance to Orchard Tower, Grab to everywhere is easy."
Comfy room and convenient. Everything is within walking distance.

Pat has been an excellent host providing great hospitality. The location of this place was very convenient being close to public transportation and the CBD. Pat is very responsive with messages and helpful in attending to needs upon request. Would highly recommend.
"The location of this place is good. It__ close to Orchard Road and MRT stations. 

The workers are friendly and helpful. 

I initially booked this for two people and In the description it said it slept up to 4 people so when other family members wanted to join me on my holiday I said they could stay with me as it sleeps up to 4 people... however, all they did was put two single mattresses on the floor. Which left no room for anything! We were all on top of each other and there was no space. So this is suited to two people max! 

There were sockets coming off the walls and there was a questionable wire coming out the shower. 

The street where the apartment was wasn__ clean  either. At night it was full of cockroaches and when I came back from my 5am run there was a massive rat in the doorway of the apartment! I know the host can__ do anything about that but it__ something to bear in mind if you__e terrified of rats like me! 

All in all the location was the best thing about this place... so it all depends on if you want location or if you want other things. 

I wouldn__ stay here again."
Wonderful stay!!
Awesome place and just nice for a peaceful alone time.
Good location
Great balcony view!!! Would definitely come again!! Same room please! 
"great place, place has good facilities and is well located. perfect for what i needed."
"I had a wonderful stay, felt really welcomed and cared for! The facilities are very new, clean and chic. A longterm stay here is absolutely recommendable. Thanks warmly."
Nice place.Nice hosting.
The windows of the room are for machines of air conditioning of building. When you open the windows you see like 6 machines that makes noice. During the night is not easy to rest. The security of the apartment seams not very high because the door of room is like a door inside apartament and not a normal out door.
"Great location, bus, mrt are so close to this place, 10 minutes walk to Orchard Road."
Good for my jouney
"Nice apartment, clean bathroom, TV (whoever will need that one in Singapore ;-)   ), basic equipment for small kitchen, large fridge / freezer, washing machine. Location is very good to explore the city, approx. one kilometer to either MRT station Somerset or MRT Station Fort Canning, walking distance (approx. 1.5 km) to Clarke Quay. MRT brings you to all the interesting spots in the city. Worth the price, for sure."
Well recommended place to stay.
overall its cleanliness is good and everything in the room is functioning good.. And its near to the city.. 
Great small apartment in a very centric location and very well communicated. Highly recommended for any individual business travelers who need accommodation for several months.
The place is awesome! the bathroom is clean considering that it is a shared bathroom. wifi is great! hot water bath is consistent and the proximity of the place is very near the mrt station making it accessible! the host is very accommodating too and helpful in giving direction! will definitely come back here
Very close to MRT
"The main issue of staying at L__ was the air conditioning leaking water when it was on. It got to the point where it soaked the extra mattress that was set up on the floor. The staff supposedly __ixed_ the issue after we reported it, but unfortunately it happened again and my family was woken up in the middle of the night because of it.

L tried to be very helpful and was apologetic about the issue, which I appreciate. Eventually the air conditioning was fixed, but this became a major inconvenience during my family__ stay there. Other than this, we didn__ have many other issues with L__ place."
"The place is a good, tidy and affordable place to stay at, although I had a bad experience. The diagonal roofing to about 1/3 of the room was directly above the sink and washing machine, and I ended bumping my head on the low ceiling multiple times around that area. Experience could be have been much different if I had a different room. Otherwise, it was easy to communicate with the staff, and quite convenient location."
"Super cute and clean room in a multistory building with multiple units. This unit seems very new and was just as pictured. The bathroom was larger than most I__e seen on Airbnb in Singapore in the downtown area. The location was good, with a bus stop right outside, or a short 30 min taxi ride from the airport. There was a washing machine and kitchenette but I didn__ use them. The AC and WiFi worked really well. I would definitely stay here again."
A nice clean modern flat in a good location. Only 10 minutes walk to orchard road and bus stop located right outside
Great location!
"The location is about 10-15 mins from the closest MRT station, the room is cozy with a kitchen and washer in it but no laundry detergent, everything else I can expected was provided, only couple minutes of hot water when shower, the network and 4k TV are great, This was fine stay overall."
"Very clean, smart use of space and all essentials provided, wonderful location too!"
"Nicely furnished, very clean apartment. However it is quite small. Additionally the walls and door are quite thin, so you will definitely be able to hear your neighbours talking, using the bathroom etc. This makes it hard to feel a sense of privacy. Otherwise the communication from our host was great, and they were very accommodating."
"Great location - 5 - 10 minute walk from Orchard Rd, Somerset MRT and Fort Canning MRT,a bus stop at the front door and a grocery shop in easy walking distance.
L was happy for us to drop our luggage of in the morning when we landed and store safely until check in time of 3pm.
Would have been nice to have a window, but in all honesty we weren__ in the room much except to sleep, as enjoying the sights of Singapore.
Bed was comfortable and it was fantastic having a washing machine in room to put clothes in for a wash and dry at end of day. 
I read on some other reviews that the hot water doesn__ last. It lasts just fine if you turn the pressure down a bit and not have it going full blast. - and still plenty of warm water for a nice shower
Would happily stay here again.
Thank you L"
Good location . Clean room but no windows that__ the only inconvenient.
Good Place. But not sound proof.
"Nice Place, Clean Well Maintain Like Brand New Apartments. Easy To Travel Around Cos The Bus Stop Near By. Thanx To The Host & Cleaning Team. Will Come Back Here Some Day, Most Well Recommended. Thumb Up"
Nice place to stay and the host response fast to my enquiries
Clean and in a convenient location.
Smaller than expected. But clean and nice.
Great place and location
Great place
"It has been grratband wonderful stay at L place. Since im travelling with 2 kids, the amenities is really helpfull ( stove, microwave and washing machine and fridge) the AC is cold , plus the bus station is right in front of the door.  It is convenient and easy to access. I definitely will stay again at L place. Thank you"
"Really nice place, smooth check in  would recommended"
Second time staying at the place. The host is nice and so was the room plus staff! Will definitely stay there again. Cheers

"Nice owner, nice place. Check in was a breeze. Thanks!"
"Excellent host. Flat was clean, access was efficient, location was central, good amenities. Had an enjoyable experience overall. Recommended."
"What an amazing place to stay in the heart of the city.  Ken and Rain are absolutely amazing hosts and went out of their way to take care of so much for us.  We loved the private pool and the other pools and gym that are a part of the building.  A private maid even cooked breakfast for us.  

Location was perfect.  Thank you again.  Definitely coming back!"
Good place to stay and relax. Commute to all places
"Shuan is a very friendly host. Room was very tidy , clean and comfortable. The check in process was very comfortable and the stay was very pleasant."
The host canceled this reservation 21 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
"This was the perfect Airbnb experience! The place was exactly as in the detailed description. The apartment is big enough, sparkling clean and has everything inside. The whole site feels like a resort. It's very quiet. They check you in and except for the cleaning which is provided twice a week, there is no one to disturb you. The host will always respond very fast if you need her though. The communication was absolutely great. 

There is a very nice pool with sunbeds and jacuzzi on the third floor. Wifi is super fast, reliable and has excellent coverage all around. The bed and the sheets were excellent too.

There is really nothing bad to say about this place. It seems that they thought about it well before letting guests in.

I highly recommend it to anyone."
Clean
All well.perfect
Clean.
Great hosts . Awesome pool .
"This is a nice modern apartment in a very good location if you have business in the Singapore CBD. The apartment was; well-appointed, very clean and well maintained. The only negative thing is that it is very small, only has one useable bedroom and a small kitchen and living room. We paid a premium price for a PentHouse thinking it would be spacious for two adults and three kids. The cost was too high for the small size and it is only really suitable for two people."
awesome! thanks!
"Faster respond msg. Place is easy to find as quit far from the center but transport is convenient by bus and train.
Nice view and spacious room."
Nicely keep in clean condition

"It__ quite comfortable and clean, also near public transportations. It__l be better if there__ a table inside the room for placing our stuff, and hairdryer in the bathroom. 
Anyway, we appreciated that the owner Julius being so helpful and we enjoyed our stay very much."

"Julius is very caring. He gives quick reponses and looked after my sister as I was not able to go with her. He offered help everyday at his initiative. He is considerate too. I appreciate that he often asked if everything is fine. My sister was so happy with her stay. Nothing bothered her and she liked the place very much. Place is near the airport, bus and train stations. So transportation won't be much of a trouble. Would definitely book again."
Julius's place is great and he was very accommodating to our late check-in and check-out times. His place was always sparkling clean and is very close to the grocery store and a Hawker centern. Getting around was a breeze as the bus and LRT are right next to the place. Julius was a great host and I'd love to stay there again if I visit Singapore again sometime (:
"Great host, very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended."
We had a good stay.
Place is really good clean and perfect for quiet time...
"Thanks Julius you were a great host, very friendly helpful and responsive. Only con was that for bigger people/pregnant like me the foam mattress really didn't accomadate for me was a bit uncomfortable the mattress. Apart from that place was always clean smelt nice and there is also a aircon in the room."
"Lovely place away from the city. It's also near to Coney Island and some hipster cafes. There's a 24hour supermarket just beside and it's  just 4 bus stops away from MRT. Despite the distance from the city centre, it's a cosy place to be at. Really clean and comfortable. Julius also has a good taste for home decor. I felt at home "
AWESOME AWESOME SERVICE!
"Perfect Stay! Very good location, 1 minute to supermarket, lots of restaurants, a nearby hawker market (around 12mins walking dist.), easy to have grab or taxi."
Great location with a food street just down below! My family and I enjoyed staying here! Was clean and communication was efficient and reliable!
"This place is truly as awesome as it looks in the listing.  It has it's own private pool on top of a downtown highrise with a view of Marina Bay, how cool is that??

The hosts are wonderful! They are very thoughtful and are on top of every detail; they will even provide transport to the location.  There is a live-in attendant that will get you anything you need anytime, too.  The building has several other amenities like a pool and (I believe) a garden that I didn't have time to check out, but I will the next time I stay there.

Tanjong Pagar MRT station is about a five minute walk.  There is also 7-11 nearby and several bars and restaurants.

If you are thinking about booking this place, stop thinking about it and just DO IT!  You will not be disappointed."
"Prime location, and a beautiful space with an awesome view! He was very flexible and catered to our needs, personally gave us a personal tour and constantly checked with us if everything was ok. 
Highly recommended!"
"Super fast response, and for my last min booking he did his best to make the place clean before I check in. The place is much better than I expected. 
Definitely gonna come back again soon.
Lastly the host is very friendly too."
super friendly and nice
Great location and value. Pool on the roof is a great touch and the view is fantastic. Would recommend.
Great place and amazing host. Will come back!
Good response from the owners and it was a wonderful stay at the premises.
"WE LOVE THIS PLACE. 

This penthouse exceeded our expectations! Ken was very welcoming and accommodating to all our requests. We had a really awesome time celebrating our dog__ birthday at his penthouse! The private pool is super romantic at night and gorgeous to chill at with a drink. The entire house is super clean, the king-sized bed was super cozy to sleep in, and there__ a projector where you can watch movies on the white wall in the room! You can see the sunrise and sunset from the bedroom/living room/pool, although we missed it as it was too cloudy. Ken was also flexible with the check out timing as there was no one coming to stay the next day. 

Thank you for being such a nice host! We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Our dog also had a lot of fun running up and down the stairs & exploring the whole house haha. We__l definitely be back!"
Perfect view and peaceful... away frm busy city....
Had a great time at the place. Will come back!
Very nice place and convenient. Very responsive hosts and considerate.
"To be honest, I was expecting a great stay as I have planned a proposal to my partner. I wouldn't deny that the host was very welcoming and detailed, but that was just the honeymoon. 

What disappoint me was that my guest either staying or just visiting to witness the proposal was needed to be charged for $80 per pax/night which wasn't mentioned clearly in the listing. 

Moreover, another disappointing event was I  was told to pay another $500 on top of what was agreed on, which is a deposit of up to $500 for property damage. I couldnt deny that it was my negligence to cause a damage, however I'm appalled that the host mentioned about the deposit was set by them and they can just change the amount to whatever amount they want. So my concern now is, at the point of agreement, it was set a deposit of up to $500 but now I'm charged at $1000 for property damage."
It__ a clean place and it is convenient. We had a pleasant experience there :)
"Room was clean, conveniently located and great value."
The host canceled this reservation 17 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
The place is in a good location. Mai is really nice and caring.
"BEST PLACE EVER! Mai's hospitality is world class, need I say more. Highly recommended!  Home away from home :)"
"I had a wonderful experience staying at Ms. Mai's place. The house is beautiful, clean and tidy. The surrounding locality is very quiet and easily accessible to MRT stations, bus stops restaurants and supermarkets. For visiting students to NUS/NTU, I think it is a good place. The kitchen is tidy and clean and sufficient for anyone to cook their own food. The host, Ms. Mai was kind enough to accommodate all my requirements.  Besides, the place is not that far from all the attractions. Overall it was a very good stay."
"Room is clean, host is nice.Price is good compare to near hotel.
A little bit far from downtown, but there are good transportation in Singapore, so I believe it doesn't bother you.
I stayed here for 9days, and I am so satisfied!"
"A warm and welcoming placed to stay with a host tuned to the needs to making guests comfortable. Mai was super responsive from the outset, easy to deal, print and responsive in early communication. Large overall apartment, close to transport. Extremely welcoming. Can highly recommended staying at here. Great value.
Cheers
Sid"
"It's a peaceful and lovely place, the view amazing. Great amenities"
"Great location, and satisfied with the quality of room and hosting. walking distance to Insead and easy to access every where by MTR. Definitely, would love to come back and strong recommendation. Many thanks Mai!"
"A chill and helpful host, what more can one ask for."
Very friendly host
"The apartment is as advertised and everything works! It is cozy, neat and tidy. There is a wonderful swimming pool on the second floor. For those who are not familiar with the area, it is really a great area. Turn out from the apartment building, walk left and you will find yourself
In Balestier Road where there are lots of eateries, including the Zhongshan Mall which is just across the street where you will find even more eateries and a large supermarket. Balestier Road is home to lots of famous eateries and bakeries. Branching off Balestier Road is Whampoa Road which is home to cheap and delicious local food favoured by the locals. Not to be missed! Turn out from the apartment building and walk right for about 6-8 mins you will reach Novena Square 2 mall which is connected to two other malls (Novena 1 and Velocity). Here you will find loads of shopping, pharmacies, supermarkets and a wide range of eateries. It is also linked to the Novena MRT (the subway)."
Great location and accommodating host. No complaints... I would stay again.
Great location
The place is comfortable and well-equipped. It is also near to lots of eateries and a shopping centre with a supermarket. Highly recommended!
Peter was a great host
Great location and apartment. Equipped with all amenities for a very comfortable stay. Close to shopping malls and restaurants making it a very convenient place to stay. Great choice for short or long stays for 2-3 people.
This is really nice apartment and good location. We really enjoy with swimming pool. Host is quick reply. Thanks Peter.
"Very clean place and most of the stuff you need for daily life is there for you. The area is also near alot of nice eateries, so there's no worry that you can't find nice food. One word, good location, and nice host."
"The apartment is small but much larger than a hotel room. Liked sitting on the balcony drinking tea in the morning. The pool is refreshing and not many people using it. The Zhongshan Mall is minutes away with easy bus transport to Chinatown, Raffles etc. Good place for hawker food and a nice little restaurant  (Thai Express). The MRT is minutes away and easy to use. We were very happy with the apartment and the pleasant neighborhood. We highly recommend it."
"Loved this flat, super convenient with a great pool and gym. Comfy bed. Highly recommended!"
"it is very convenient location,easy for traffic ,food and shipping"
Good

"Excellent location. Host was very helpful and the whole process was smooth. The place is very cozy and overall, the stay was amazing! :)"
"I was removed from the property after 1 night because AirBnb is illegal in Singapore and the government were coming to do a spot check. I was offered a full refund on the phone by the __roperty manager_ only for that to change to full refund minus the one night in spite of the inconvenience and illegality of the operation.  The property manager did drive me to my next accommodation however, being forced into booking new accommodation and leaving within a matter of 2 hours was far from ideal.  I was given 2 other options: to move to a hotel for 2 days and then go back to the accommodation that was being checked or, go to another flat that didn__ have a kitchen (Just a toaster and a kettle from the photo I was shown) - not acceptable since I had just purchased $125 worth of groceries for my stay. 

Please be aware of the Government stance on this prior to booking in Singapore."

"Very gracious and helpful hosts.  The unit is very clean and easy to find, and the neighborhood is very homey. There is a nearby mall for a variety of choices for food and shopping. I enjoyed my stay! Thank you, Vicki and Sun!"
"Vicki's place is ideal for exploring Singapore. It's really close to the station which makes any place easily accessible. The room and the bath are very clean and comfortable, while the flat has everything you might need. Vicki is really helpful and will quickly answer any of your questions. Will definitely select this place again next time I visit Singapore."
I went to bring my grandparents for medical visits. The apartment provides quick access to Mount Elizabeth and various malls on walking distance. I recommend the apartment for families or travellers in group.
A great facilities.. high end condominium project in a great location.
"Very nice and comfortable place, great facilities, great location, near highlighted shopping mall in Orchard also easy access to paragon and way to Mount Elizabeth Hospital, The host is super nice and responsive. Thank you, Hope we can stay there again for our next trip to sg :)"
This place is perfect!
"Great  location for shopping and sightseeing, taxi stand meters away from the lobby, direct bridge from building to The Paragon. 
The apartment itself is new and well kept, the kitchen is fully equipped (we actually cooked since we travel with a baby). Grocery store in Paragon has all the staples. 
The hosting team did great job responding our requests in minutes. 
Overall - very pleasant stay, would definitely stay here again."
Host is friendly and nice welcoming us. Apartment is clean and near shopping malls. My family will choose to stay here if we travel to Singapore.
"Beware of two things - that you may be asked to sign a rental agreement regarding non-vandalism which I refused stating that this is non-standard & be charged for things which may not be your fault. Upon check-in I had accidently opened an already faulty drawer and the host instantly said he would have to charge me for it.  The top kitchen drawer had a small sticker which said ""permanently locked. please do not force"" which I had overlooked.  It came off instantly but this was because one of the hinges was already broken hence the sign.  A dispute followed and in the end the host decided he would not charge me.

A number of items that I had expected were missing upon arrival - e.g. third bedroom was not made up (they erroneously thought I had booked 2 bedrooms) and its door couldn't close completely, hand towels, hand soap, rice cooker (in prior exchanges they had said there would be one). The host did react quickly and resolved these issues on the same day.  

Despite the initial unpleasant check-in encounter, we did enjoy our stay - the apartment is clean, very well located with good views and facilities."
Everything is good. I'll return when I have a chance to go to Singapore. Thanks all.
"Apartemen bersih,strategis,nyaman,walau harus jalan sedikit jauh ke mrt tp secara umum bagus "
Ben and Jo were great hosts. They respond quick and the place we stayed at had superb location to orchard malls.
Aaron is very accurate and helpful host. The place was perfect for our business trip and I greatly recommend it!
"Aaron is a great host. He responds quickly to messages and very considerate to our needs (we stayed with a toddler and a baby). The house is clean and neat, a bit far from MRT Station but many options for bus stop. There are also foods and mini-marts nearby."
Decent enough place for the price. Location is central and plenty of good food nearby.
"Swimming pool quite good, when you checking in they taking $100 deposit for a room safety, and when you check out they give you back. Breakfast area a little bit small and breakfast three stars. location hotel quite good, easy go to the centrum by walk in about half hour, but it is Bus Stop 1 minute, metro station 10 minutes walk (name station Bugis)."
"Clean, well located, super hospitable, affordable. 
Great stay"

"The place was secured, simple, and the price i paid match my expectations, this property is valuable for those budget traveller amidst the pricey hotel in Singapore. All information was clear and the property is clean enough also I have no issue while staying here."

"Excellent location, reasonable price, lovely host."
"Aaron and Kevin are very responsive to the issue with faced. They also provided us with the gate remote so that we can park both our vehicles and also sent a technician to fix the television. 

One thing that could be improved on was the internet connection as the connection was unstable and poor due to the usage of multiple repeaters, so we actually used our own 4G network throughout our whole stay."
"I highly recommend this place! It is super clean, the view is outstanding, we had our private pool and we had access to the public areas of the building. Extremely safe and Ken was so nice to show us around the area where to eat and super fast communication, anything you need he__ there to help and make you feel like home! He also helped us giving us recommendations of food to where to go in our stay. Everything is walk-in distance, gardens of the bay, malls etc ... It__ super safe to come late and you have a 24 hrs Mc Donald__ a block away if you get night cravings. We either walked or got a Grab (Uber), but everything is basically close by.  We couldn__ have chosen a better airbnb then this one! Highly recommend!"

A quiet and comfortable place to yourself. House is spacious and furnished quite well. A place you should consider to stay at.
"Conrad's place is sparkling clean, spacious and windy and come with a magnificent view of Singapore flyer and the sea. Super easy to get cab and it is short walking distance to Dakota mrt (15mins). To get to the nearest beach, it's just 7-10mins via underpass. Parents love the pool and jacuzzi. Highly recommended, special to thanks to Nirosha as well. (Family of 5, 2 weeks stay approx.)"
"Quite center in the city, Just 3mins waking to MRT station (two MRT station); easily go to anywhere.  Quite new house, clean and quite. City view from the balcony was amazing, beautiful sunset . Host was quite friendly although she is not at home most of the time but text response was fast. Value for money as a city center stay."
The apartment is at good location. It has a hawkers market nearby so that you can grab quick meal there. Amy has quick response at almost every time. The house is in good condition however needs more caring.
Nice place and friendly host
"Mai ist eine sehr angenehme und herzliche Person, die sich rundum um ihre GÃ¤ste und einen angenehmen Aufenthalt bemÃ¼ht! FÃ¼r viele nÃ¼tzliche Tipps nimmt sie sich jede Menge Zeit! 

Das Zimmer war stets sauber und es gab nichts zu bemÃ¤ngeln! Das Zentrum erreicht man mit dem MRT in ca. 20 min (30 min inkl. Weg zum MRT) und eine EinkaufsmÃ¶glichkeit ist in 4-5 Minuten fu_lÃ¤ufig zu erreichen.

Ich wÃ¼rde jederzeit wiederkommen! 
Vielen lieben Dank fÃ¼r die Gastfreundschaft..."
I can only recommend this apartment
"Mai has been a great host. My daughter spend approximately 4 months at her place and felt safe in the friendly environment. She told me ""Mai is an outgoing person who also enjoys her personal space, so whether your preference is to socialise or stay on your own, she will be respectful of it. If you are renting after COVID19, she spends most of her day at work, if you are renting during quarentine times, she might still be under a homeoffice regime so prepare for a more intense communal living experience. She is serious about having things in order,  but this helps ensure the apartment is always clean and tidy. She is a bright person, who taught me yoga and cooked and hanged out in great harmony with me. I would recommend renting with her as she is a nice soul who will try to be franc and amicable and make your time there peaceful and enjoyable. Thank you for everything Mai!""  I must also add, that as a parent, it made me feel at ease, having my daughter close to university, in a good appartement, which infrastructure and a healthy environment. Thank you Mai. Sincerely, Paulo Modesto"
Very nice place.  Convenient. =)
Definitely will book again for sure.

Great place to stay at
Place was v clean and nice. Love it. Will visit again!
Great location!
"We enjoyed our time in the apartment. It is as per the pictures however the living area itself is smaller than what I thought it would be. 
Easy check in & check out, great location. Some things I would have liked - hand soap in the bathrooms, manual on instructions on how to use washing machine/dryer. Room smelt of cigarette smoke when we arrived, but we were able to air it out but then the smell came back again so perhaps someone in the building was smoking and it came through air con vents. Also the bedrooms are very light at night, would be great if they put black out blinds as this would be a real issue for some people. All in all great stay and I would stay there again if I was looking for somewhere in Club Street as the location is amazing."
"Great place, and only a short walk from rows and rows of good food"
"Great location, cozy space!"
Not bad
"Great stay! Despite the last min change, as i__e booked a stay in a 2BR apt, but due to unforeseen circumstances from Jean__ side, I was given 2x 1BR apts instead, which was fine by me  Also Jean gave speedy replies and managed to accommodate my also quite last min change, initially booked on the 16 July 2020, but me and my friends couldn__ make it and we managed to amend the stay to a later date, without any additional fees. Thank you so much Jean!"
"Room is clean and the location is a plus point! Great place, we enjoyed our stay here!"
Hassle free check in. Jean was quite fast in replying to me. Our stay was fine. Spacious  apartment. Great location. Def will book again.

"I have been there for almost an entire month. It was such a pleasant  experience that I truly wish there would be  another chance to book and stay in that room again. Mr. Lu and his family are friendly people with great hospitality. The room was clean and tidy, which located in a condo building. Generally, as it is within the walking distance to Jurong East mrt station and shipping centers nearby, there are various choices for transportation services and recreation. BTW, that was quite a view outside the window every morning."
"__¸¸å¥½ç__¿é_,__¸¸å¥½ç__¿ä_~"
Ok
Great value for stay. Walls may be a little thin so bring earplugs. Overall good experience!
"The host tried to sneak one by me. Switched up my room before I checked in and then tried to claim it was a free upgrade for me, when in fact the price difference was $100. Then I had to clean boogers off of the wall next to my bed, and got bed bugs! Really, really miserable experience."
"High value stay. Not very big room, but perfect to save my day for a friend stay.

Location is convenient, walkable to both lavender and farrer park mrt. 
Conveniences stores 24hrs around here since a few other hotels in this neighbourhood.

Didn't meet the host himself but self checkin was simple easy to follow.

Almost everyone else here is expats staying long term. Interesting people."
"It__ a fantastic experience to be living in the White Castle! Shuyun is a very friendly and responsive host. Her home is so clean, comfortable, and convenient. I am grateful to have a great experience of living there, and thank you for making me feel at home!"
"Absolutely clean and well organised, Shu allowed me to leave my heavy luggages even before the check-in time. Also, offered me to take a Quick shower which was very nice. 

Room itself was very clean, well organised and quiet. 

Very prompt in replying on (Hidden by Airbnb) so communication was fantastic and precise. 

Check out was also very flexible, no rush or any pressure... Totally recommend their place much better than any budget hotels. 

So sweet of them, they also offered me an Umbrella _ and told me to keep it to myself :)"
"Very thoughtful nice host. Anyone will enjoy staying over there. Fast responsive host, clean place and convenient for foods and shopping (Mall just nearby abt 10mins walk). Just a bit far if going to city side(Orchard road exp). Other than that great for value for short stay."
Everything as described. Michelle is a great host and very responsive.
"The convenience of this apartment is hard to beat.  It's an easy 7-8 minute walk to MRT, Heartland Mall (which has a Cold Storage and a nice selection of hawkers), or 10 mins to the Surin Avenue park.  There are plenty of good restaurants nearby.

The building has a swimming pool and small gym area on the roof, which has a nice view at night.  The apartment itself is placed in the corner furthest from the road with a pleasant view of some trees.  It's fairly quiet at all hours, even during rush hour.  It's easily accessible via elevator or stairs.  The interior has basic necessities and is spacious enough for 1-2 people.

The owners were professional, responsive, and good to work with.  I would recommend staying with them!"
Great place with even greater host. Highly recommended. Spacious and comfortable. Really feel like home. Joyce is a super great.
Amazing host. Amazing place.
Great place to stay. Host is super friendly and helpful. Place is clean and convenient. Suitable for long term and short term stay.

The nearby mall/train station has everything you need and a good range of food options. The fan is definitely strong enough to keep cool for those worried about having no AC. The cats are very very friendly and overall my stay was really pleasant."
The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
"Places was super clean and comfy, will not worry about being homesick. Lovely hospitality and friendly 2 furry cat friends"
"Nice place, windy, convenient as food courts and markets are near, though far from the CBD and zoo."
"The place is very clean and neat and quite, which is suitable for work. There are parks around to go for a run. The family is very nice and friendly"
"_¿ç_ was always very responsive trying to make sure we didn't miss everything and his house has pretty much all we needed. 
It is well located close to a train station so you are never very far from an interesting point in Singapore.
The house was very clean and well equipped.
Among the Airbnb appartements we had in Singapore, it was one on the best value for money.

Thanks for having us !"

"The apartment was really nice and stylish in spite of its size. Location is great, just a couple minutes away from the train and bus stops. There are a few establishments in the area that are open 24 hours, so that was a good thing for us night owls. Highly recommended!"
Nice room
"The house is exactly like this picture. Small and cosy. Bed is a bit too soft for my liking. Other that that, all is great."
"Great value for Singapore! Exactly what we were looking for our stay in Singapore. Clean apartment and clear instructions to get in. Location is pretty close to get to downtown, I would definitely stay again."

"Good position and includes some must have amenities such as a pool and a washing machine. I really appreciated how clean it felt, and the air con in every room. Can get hard to relax at night due to traffic noise and late night shouting (happened more than once during our stay)."
Great host. Really convenient location and only 5min walk to the MRT. The place was well kept. Really nice neighbourhood with plenty of eating options.
Very nice place with very good location. Check-in process was very smooth. Will definitely book this house again nextime.

The host is very clean and comfortable.  I'll come back
"Very nice place, we love our stay"
"Okay place for a night. Beds are soft, that was a plus to us. Traffic noise was tolerable in the second bedroom."
"Thank you for hosting us. Our family had a great stay! The place is exactly as how it was advertised. I like that it is clean and there were even extra cleaning supplies in stock. The place is spacious for a family of 5. Near Aljunied MTR and a couple of bus stops. The surrounding is quiet and safe. Overall, it is a good option for a group."
"Nice Place to Stay, Highly Recommended."
"The apartment is nicely decorated. Have aircon and ceiling fan in every room. Great location with mrt, shops and food nearby. However, cleanliness was average."

Cozy stay and host and caretaker were very responsive and helpful.
"The apartment is not bad. Well suited for a short time. Good location: there is a metro and bus stop nearby, several shops and many Chinese restaurants. Disadvantages: there was practically no dishes, but the owners quickly provided them."
"Great place, just a short 10min walk passing famous eateries and a supermarket to town.

Quiet and not noisy at night. Place was within my expectations and true to pictures. 

Clean amenities and fresh towels and sheets.

Furniture were slightly worn out. But all is good."
Great getaway place
"Highly satisfied with the place its clean, cozy, private, feels like home and accessible. All under 15 minutes walking distance to Somerset, Orchard Road, Dhoby Ghuat, Clark Quay, Fort Canning and Boat Quay
.
Ong is highly responsive and helpful. Her place is highly recommended!"
"A small place with basic necessities covered, walking distance to orchard and Robertson quay. Will be good for short term travellers!"
"Location is exceptionally good. Bus stop is just downstairs. And easy to get away to downtown areas like sommerset/orchard/clark quay. There are food places and supermarket in walkable distance, so pretty convenient. Studio is clean and considered quite spacious. Staff are helpful and responsive. Good place to stay in."
"Great place to stay. The studio is clean, spacious and located in prime location. The check in is very fast and efficient and able to accommodate for enquiries. Thank you"
Value for money!
Good
"Good place, near town."
"Clean, worth the money, really spacious and comfy! Highly Recommend"
A good place to relax.
An affordable listing in a good location. The listing is small and the bed isn__ that comfortable. Good listing for a quick stay .
"Nice place, good communication and easy & convenience check in."
"Awesome host who is quick to respond to my messages. The place is also conveniently located just a mere 5 minutes walk from a 24h supermarket and 10 minutes from Somerset MRT. The room itself had basic kitchen amenities like a microwave, induction cooker etc. Although the room was stylish and minimal, it had down at heel areas which made the room look less appealing than photographed. Overall, still an enjoyable stay :)"
Good location. Easy access to CBD. My unit faces the street so it was a bit noisy. Sound proof was not good. There__ a dormitory unit next door and the guys were talking non stop at nights and you can hear everything.
"great place to stay for couples!:) small yet cozy, near somerset313 as well!!"

Room is a little tiny and located in the 4th floor and another downside is the elevator only goes up to 3rd floor. You have to use a flight of stairs to go up to your room. For us who have luggages is a bit challenging however host assistant helped us with our luggage. Room is sparkling clean and modern. Very fast wifi as well. Didn__ meet the host in person but assistant was the one always in the building. Also host allowed us to store our luggages before we checked in since we arrive a little earlier. Over-all it__ a great place to stay and closer to everything. Oh bus stop is just outside the unit so very convenient for us tourist visiting Singapore.
Good place. easy to access
Wonderful host.
"The place, as others have said, is very clean, but we could not stay long in a windowless room and had to leave. There is little storage which necessitates living out of our suitcases, fine for a few nights but not long term especially as ours was supposed to be a special holiday. We left after 4 nights to a lovely hotel for a very similar price."
"Great location just off Tanjong Pagar, rooms felt very homey and interiors were warm. Appreciated all the conveniences in making the co-living space a comfortable one. I would definitely be coming back again. :)"
Really nice and convenient place to stay!
"Loved the concept. Nice and clean communal kitchens (big & small) with fancy coffee machines. The Staffs were super friendly and helpful.  Big thank for all of you. We stayed at The Large, so we had our own kitchen and washer/dryer. Everything almost perfect except the bathroom. I wish it was not __et_ bathroom and had  shelves. Please give bench or something to sit instead of giant plants and uncomfortable high chairs. 
Definitely we will come back"
location is great and the amenities are nice. staff are very helpful and friendly. easy access to TP area and freeway to go on about SG
"My wife and I stayed here for 2 weeks when we first arrived in Singapore, while looking for an apartment to rent. It was a great place for us, allowing us to cook meals in our room, unpack a bit (we had a XL), and the staff helped us get around and understand the city."
"I stayed in a large size room for 2 weeks for business trip, the room decoration attracted me to choose this apartment. Staffs are very nice and helpful, they told me this new hotel established for 3 months only. The location is convenient, only 10 mins walking distance to the nearest shopping mall and Tanjong Pagar Plaza Market. However, as the room do not have table for work, the high chair is too high for me to use laptop on the kitchen table. One thing suggest to improve is there are no space to put toiletry stuff in the washroom, this is a bit inconvenient. The place is very nice for holiday but not for business trip. You can use the big lobby anytime and they provided free beer for you to relax and Chi chi-chat with you friend.
This hotel is highly recommended and will visit again."

The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
"Nice room, good location!"
"Great Host, very friendly and responsive. 
Tidy and cozy place. 
Location are in superb 5 min walk to Whampao Food market, View Step to Bus Stop and 10 min by Bus to Novena MRT station. 
like 5 start hotel amenities (shaver, stream, iron, lotion, extra pillows)"
"They are very nice host!
Room and bathroom are clean and large enough for one person.

Location is little far from downtown, but it is about 20 min to Orchard by bus, so it is very useful.
There is an restaurant inside condominium so you need not go outside to have dinner when you don__ have time."
Check in is a breeze
The place was great. The room was clean and spacious. Toilet was great. Would recommend to anyone going to singapore with a tight budget.
Very great value if you have all 3 guests to split the cost. Wish they had at least addressed the huge puddle in bathroom. The staff who walked me in saw the water all over the bathroom and did not comment; therefore I thought perhaps they had just cleaned it. I eventually spotted the drip in the pipes near the toilet. Wifi was spotty during peak times but not a big deal. The place looks exactly like the pictures.
A very comfortable place to stay during my holiday. Very much to recommend this place to my family and friends
___£ã__§ã_
"Place is very nice & I have been here for 3 Months. Amenities close by very close to MRT stations / food courts 24/7. 

Host responses quite well & quick! The cleanliness of the bathrooms & toilets are not wow because of the tenants usage. But for the budget price & for a long stay defo a good one!"
Overall ok
_¨ã______è¿__ä½_________
"The place is located comfortably close within the city, (i.e., near an MRT station, a shopping mall, 24-hour Mustafa centre), but not too close as there not much noise during the evenings and weekends. Ananda is a gracious host, which we have had smooth communication with. He is assisted by househelpers, who keep the place clean, and tend to changing the bedsheets every few days or so. Overall, I would consider our stay a very good experience."
Fantastic value for money and highly communicative and responsive host
Nice place in a good location
This is a nice and clean place.
"Its a nice place to be, we are checking in a bit late, but he patiently waiting for us, and helped us to get to his place"
"The room and house was very nice, clean and comfortable. I really like the house__ design, it was super nice also.

Ben as the host was very helpful, quick response, and and very kind. We can got any information from him. 

Definitely will come back again to stay at this house and will be my top favorite place to stay."
"Ben is a such great host. He stayed connected, welcomed and oriented us immediately on how to navigate the area. Bus stations are right in front of the building and MRT station is one bus away. The place is also close to a food center, bakery that serves good pastries and a 24 hour grocery. The room is stylish and clean. Ben let us refill our water bottles so we didn__ have trouble buying water through out the trip. The location allowed us to feel like locals since we need to understand the transport system. I enjoyed my stay and would love to book this again the next time I visit Singapore."
"My family had a really nice stay at Lawrence's . Hassle free check in, fast response. Everything we need is there. I brought my two toddlers with me.and they enjoyed the pool where there's a private entrance from the room."
"Lawrence was polite kind sincere and extremely accommodating. A simple appartment with all the needs, close to everything you need and mrt. Extremely well kept. He obliged to puck us up from the airport and offered to drop us off. I'll definatelybe returning"
-
"Very accomodating host, quick to answer, even fetch us at the metro. Nice place. Very accessible to supermarkets, resto, bus. Although a little bit far from the metro."
"Me and my friends only stayed here for 1 night but it was an enjoyable experience. We wanted to have a BBQ and luckily Lawrence's place had a BBQ pit right by the swimming (which we could access from his private entrance so that was really convenient). Lawrence not only helped us booked the pit but also allowed us to check-in slightly earlier so our food could be delivered. 

We mainly stayed within the condominium throughout so we did not explore the area a lot (but we would not recommend going out alone at night). If you're looking to just have a house to hold you and your friends through the night, this is an option to consider. However, if you're thinking about going out and exploring the area, I would recommend elsewhere."
good
"Adequate space for 3-4 people. Clean, speedy wifi, nice bathroom. Smooth checkin & checkout, good communication from the host."

great place to explore singapore
"Clean place with great facilities! Well equipped with washing machine, fridge, oven and swimming pool! Swimming pool & a small exercise place is available as well"
Nice place. Proximity to the public conveyance like buses and metro. Quiet place. Not too much noise. Having swimming pool is an added advantage. Overall it is worth of the investment done. Recommended for stay.
Great place.  Awesome pool
The location is very convenient. Thank you!
Hassle-free check-in process
Great location with many shops nearby. A bit small for 5 people but overall a good apartment. easy check in and everything you need you can find in the Apartment

"Great apartment for an extended stay in Singapore. Set in a row of lovely shop houses the apartment was very stylish, and clean. The apartment is also in a fantastic location near MRT and bus routes as well as a supermarket to pick up groceries. The coffee shops of Jalan Basar and the restaurants of Little India are all in walking distance."
Great value for money in a very convenient location. Our 5 weeks stay was very pleasant.
"____,ä¼____¸´"
"Generally, it was a great stay. Value for money. Walking distance to MRT, bus station, hawker centre and market. Quiet and comfortable environment. Come with private swimming pool and public garden. Would recommend others to consider this place when they visit SG.

One disadvantage of this stay is its location (Kovan). Slightly far from main attractions as it would take at least 30 minutes to each location. However, it is accessible by different transportations. Hence, it was convenient to us. 

P/S : If you are taking KKKL bus from MY to SG, there is a drop off point right behind the residence."
A simple room with basic amenities but do expect to share the place with others as the room is located in a 3 room apartment.
Nice place
"Must check it out to feel the (Website hidden by Airbnb) looks like a normal room in the photo but in reality,I'll rate it 10/10.And complete amenities with a clean toilet and a pool.Such a nice place to relax."
"It__ a wonderful place like my house, Kit and Tom is quite friendly and understanding even they are not there. We really enjoyed the eight nights at there. Hope can meet your guys at singapore."
I loved my two weeks stay at Kt__ place.
Very clean. Get lot of privacy.

This is a nice place to stay and existing roommate is nice too.
Thanks for the stay!
A wonderful cosy place
The place was clean. Enjoyed my stay there :)
"My stay here was a bit sub-par, owing to the property showing its age and needing some maintenance on a number of items. There was a nice bed and fast WiFi, so it could be manageable if that's all you want. However, it didn't meet my expectations for a place to live in for any extended period of time. If the owner can invest in its improvement, it does have potential, so perhaps check back if that's the case."
Perfect experience in the nice and beautiful apartment. Location is near to everything that you needed. Got some little problems at the first day after check in. But Jean help us fix it right away. Appreciate it a lot.I would love to book again next time .
Nice place.
So nice So clean

"Cosy little apartment, just right for 2 ppl. The place was very clean, WiFi is fast, aircon in both living room and bedroom. Wouldn't mind staying here again."
"Host is really understanding and patient! My 2nd stay here and she rly doesn__ disappoint !! Love the place. it__ stylish, clean and spacious."
Nice and quiet place to stay.
Nice clean cosy room. Love the high ceiling.
"The place was near to mrt , it had bars near by"
Great location and a very cosy place to stay in. Would be good if there are curtains to block the sunlight but everything else is perfect love it.
Lovely place
Place is cosy and location is convenient.
Nice place
Very god place
Most valueable stays you could find at Singapore.
Great Place to stay at! It was better than I expected.
"The hotel is really clean and the location is also good as the green mrt line is just about 8 min by foot. I stayed for 7days and I had no problem at all as everything was very convenient and communication with the host was rly promptly done. The only thing was that the housekeeping is carried out like every single day which  would be preferred for some travelers, but since I was just taking a break and didnt go out too often, it was a little bit disturbing. So, I think it will be much better if it is carried out on request, instead. Anyways, the place is a great value for your money!"
This place is in an excellent location! Equal walking distance to Marina Bay and Clark Quay. There is also a very hip area around the corner on club Street. I found plenty to do and planning to eat all throughout the area I was staying. The place was very easy to check in and check out of without the use of a key card. Although the room was small it was very functional and very easy to move around in. They provide towels and house slippers to walk around in. I would suggest bringing your own shower slippers. The Cook lab was a great common area with free coffee and space to work. There is a diner down the stairs however it was not open due to continued Construction. I was very please with my stay I would highly recommend.
"Great located, stylish place, super friendly and helpful agents and host! Definitely a recommendation!!!"
Nice place to stay. Around the area has all the shops and restaurants you need. Very satisfied to stay there and hopefully i be back to stay more.

"This is hostel, hence you need to manage your expectation.  Final touch of interior didn't finish yet. It means some parts are new and some parts are not fully ready . If you manage the expectation, it's not bad. Location is good to go biz area and China town. Registration is automated through chatbot or somebody. Hence you're not familiar with this, you may take some time to register.  Number of shower booth are enough.  Water pressure is good."
nice and clean
"Super friendly and helpful staff, great location in Tanjong Pagar, stayed here for a few times already, definitely a recommendation!"
Pretty good value for money room.
Very great place to enjoy and stay! High recommend if you wanna find some comfortable place to stay! So quiet and clean.

very nice!!!
CLEAN! I enjoyed how modern the space was as well. Loved my experience here overall!
"So much nicer than expected! Lovely staff and amenities. 
Clean and can assure privacy."
"I only needed a place for a bit of the night before I departed early and everything about this place was exactly what I needed. They were very responsive and check-in was easy! Plus the location was a short walk from the subway and very close to lots of great shops, restaurants, etc. Plus, the place was very clean! I would definitely stay again."
Outstanding set up
Awesome place. Much cleaner than expected. Comfortable beds and quick responses from the team with helping me get the TV on haha. Will be back for sure!
An extension of my last stay here. I ended up staying here for 5 nights. Super close to Tanjong Pagar MRT and lots of food options. The room was large enough to accommodate 2 large suitcases and one small one.
"Perfect location! Very clean and nice if you want some privacy. Very modern facilities (mile kitchen, dyson hairdryer, rainshower etc.)"
Very good and affordable
A quaint little space. It was much better than expected. Had enough room for me to store 2 large suitcases and a carry-on. Bed was very comfortable and TV in bed cabin was a plus!
"convenient, clean, cozy room"
"Want to live in a greatly designed space in the heart of Singapore with most things a short walk away and a bundle of amenities? This is the place for you.

I stayed here for about a month and had a very comfortable experience. A nice shared kitchen, quality toiletries provided, free access to coffee all day, a great top deck and a comfortable bed.

The rooms can feel a little small but for this price in Singapore, it's a steal."
Very convenient way to check in and out and best value for money  for the location !
"Awesome location. Proximity to supermarkets, hawker centre (yum yum local delicacies), metro stations and local attractions etc.

The room ain't big, but it's relaxing and functional. The kitchen is well equipped and the staffs are just like Singapore weather, warm and sunny.

Kudos to the team at ST Signature, well done!"
Stretegic and clean place. Have a lot of shops and restaurants nearby the hotel.
"Had a wonderful stay there, its more than I expected to be."
Amazing customer service. Everything was smooth and accurate. Thank you Ling

Perfect place for peace.
"Clean, modern, phenomenal location. For the price can't be beat."
Super nice and price very reasonable.
Very nice!
"I stayed at this location when it was offering a special discount during singapore's circuit breaker. The check-in process is relatively easy once you download the app and they are quick to respond via the app or on the iPad in the lobby. The rooms itself were clean but there was reduced room cleaning I think due to the CB. Washrooms were clean, the kitchen may or may not be. The kitchen is shared among the entire coliving hotel so it can get crowded during peak meal times. I cannot speak to  the atmosphere of the space since it was during the CB."
"Good location, easy to find, close to mrt and good quality beds. Enjoyed my stay even if it is a short one."
Great place
"Everything is okay, accept for the bedroom door that is spoilt and make so much noise."
Clean and nice place to stay.
very clean and much better than what i expected! very worth it for the price :)
Very nice place

Great place with a great location and amenities

Not bad but just some small problem with the amenities there.
Cheap and good
"Is a great place for overnight stay , but do remember to get your own bottles of water as they don__ provide also slippers. But other Than that is still a definitely a nice place to stay . Less than $100 for a place that is almost like an hotel room and in CBD Definitely value for money"
"great place to crash,all is clean.towel is provided.excellent"
"The place is really nice, amenities are well-kept. Room is just tidy and enough space for 1pax. Just what I needed at that time. Will rebook soon!"

Cozy and the location is perfect !
"Overall a cozy tiny place for you to crash in the central of Singapore, location is amazing with great food, malls, convenient stores, MRT all in walking distance"
Value for money! 
I'm very satisfied. I'm kind and I keep my personal privacy.
Thankyou
nice and clean.a room not smelly
Good place for the price
"Ling's place is nice to stay, either for short time vacation or long stay living for businesses trip. The room is clean and have enough space to put on medium baggage. Plus, you get a LED TV with netflix and good internet connection in your room. They always keep clean their public area e.g. lobby, kitchen, toilet, and bathroom. Also, with the covid-19 pandemic situation, they keep good health protocol in order. Feel safe to stay here. Thank you."
"I think I__l miss the shampoo more than anything else  It__ of great quality and smells amazing! The space was really nice, bathroom and kitchen have high quality amenities and are kept very clean. Sheets were of good quality and bed was comfortable. I much prefer the rooms with windows (though you get a tv if you don__ have a window)."
"The host and the community host was very helpful during my stay. Thank you for the help on the requests I've requested.   The toilet is clean, showering is good with hot water. Room is neat and clean as well. Thank you."

"The space was really stylish and love the bed. The self check-in was great for my late arrival, didn't need to be afraid of arriving to no staff as I was able to check-in 24hours before arrival.

This airbnb has lived up to my expectations of cleanliness and hospitality. I would suggest this location to anyone and everyone visiting Singapore. The location is only minutes from Tanjong Pagar station and seconds away from hawker centres.
My stay was wonderfull.. the room is small bit big enough for one person of you are on a City trip.
"Great value! New and impeccable place, very convenient location. Modern finishings, loved the kitchen lab with coffee machine, free drinking water and all you need for cooking and chill. Rooms are as described and bathrooms are great, loving the dyson hairdryer :) Helpful and friendly staff.  I'll definitely come back for my future stay in SG. Thanks again for your hospitality!"
"Is it worth your money? Yes! 
It__ very clean, very stylish, great location, hosts answer pretty quickly and would help immediately with anything. 
However, the only down side is that the sound proof is pretty terrible and let__ say a quarter of the times that I would get a shower, I couldn__ get hot water.  They have Dyson hair dryers which I absolutely appreciate thought! 

Bottom line, I would recommend it to anyone that it__ traveling on their own. They have a great price for what they offer. 

Beware that if you need to leave your stuff at the lockers, you need to bring your own lock."
"Incredible value for money! Amazingly central location, super clean and comfortable facilities. Super responsive hosts and a seamless check in experience. Definitely would recommend anyone visiting Singapore to check this place out."
"Small, but great room and was very clean.  Thanks for the great stay."
"This is an excellent place to base yourself out while staying in Singapore. Very clean and with good amenities. Close to many restaurants and hawker centres.  I really appreciated being able to control the room temperature and having a coffee in the morning. Bed was very comfortable. Only thing is it__ a bit impersonal, although the hosts are quick to respond to messages."
"Value to money. 
Great location with food is all around the hotel.
Convenient to travel within SG with MRT. 
The hostel is self-automated system.
Very clean and cozy style hotel.

Best choice for single trip and safe for money."
"Booked this place on behalf of my friend, he did mention that the place was as showed in the page, it was clean, stylish and location wise super convenient, everything was within a short walking distance. Before, during and after the stay, Fang was super helpful and replied very quickly to my enquiries. Kudos to the team!"
Loved the room layout and the modern decor. Also loved the strong and modern showers and smart TV. You definitely get more than what you paid for.
Very good
Nicely renovated with clean facilities. Good value for money.
"The place is located in the city, minutes away from various delicious local cuisines. Likewise, the premise is a walk away from the nearest MRT & bus station, which can be easily located. 

The room is clean and smells good, and is well-represented by the pictures. Throughout the stay, the shared bathroom is always clean and available.

Overall, a pleasant experience."
Good!
"Great place for travellers if all you need is a good night's rest. Comfortable bed and cosy space - well equipped with power + USB sockets. Surprisingly comfortable for the cost. Location is ideal as there are many food options around, short walk to train stations and nearby attractions. 

However don't bother with cooking as the kitchen is always crowded and utensils not properly washed. Shared toilet not so clean, but luxurious bathrooms with the rain shower and constant supply of hot water no matter at which time of day. Loved the space and lighting in the bathroom as well, very relaxing for a nice hot shower.

Overall some room for improvement, but no complaints given the budget!"
Top the list to go for a temporary housing solution.
"Highly recommend, Super markets are 5 mins away. And it__ very convenient"
"Was convenient check in and value for money for the location hotel is situated . 
Will definitely look forward to booking again"
Location and parking is very easy very near tanjong pagar and the bed is very comfortable!

"It was much better than what I had expected. Showers and toilets were very clean (which is a difficult accomplishment), kitchen was well equipped, cabin room was cozy and clean, wifi connection was great and location was stellar. Although nobody was there physically for the check-in, the virtual help was very responsive. Couldn't ask for more."

Wonderful stay
Great stay
"Great stay. It was clean, comfortable and host and concierge were responsive."
good place for short term
"I would recommend this Co-Living space but not this particular room that I stayed in. The amenities of the building are outstanding, and the location is excellent, but the room I was in was way to loud to sleep in. However, I think this is just a problem with this particular room, and I'm sure the others are fine."
"The location is very convenient and checkout is easy and automatised. The room is clean and comfortable with window and natural light. It is located in a good side of the building where isn't noisy (from restaurants and night life). I had a nice stay and woukd stay again. 

The only restriction to be noted is that the bed is high and the access to it is a bit tricky. You need to use small steps and literally step on the desk. Not suitable for elderly people or unfit adults. Bed protection bar isn't made to be held as well. "
"The interior is amazingly renovated with great attention to detail. The shared spaces such as the showers and the toilets have very well thought out lighting. For example, the motion sesnor is present in each cubicle, so that the energy-saving auto switch-off will not trigger even if you are in a cubicle. The inclusion of a dyson hair-dryer was beyond expectation."
"Property is stylish. The shared toilets are relatively clean, especially the shower areas. Room was clean and tidy.

However, my room's (104) window faced the alley, so it was wasted as i had to close the curtains. In addition, it was very noisy, i could hear people walking past, their conversations, and also vehicles driving past. i recommend to book a room without window instead, as it is a hit or miss and you may get a similar room as mine that faces the alley/street and is noisy. Also note that to climb onto the bed you will have to step on the table.

Location of the property is good as there are many restaurants (korean, japanese) and malls (Guoco, 100AM, icon village) nearby within less than 10min walk. So overall this property is recommended for the location and price, but on hindsight i should have chosen a lower bed room without window instead."
"9/10 experience! Self check-in was fast and easy, no need to check in manually at the counter. The room was is indeed very small, but not a problem since we did not carry luggages. It was super cozy and clean, and the bed was very comfortable to sleep in! Though the only issue was it was a little troublesome to have to travel to the shared bathrooms since the female__ one is on level 2 while my assigned cabin was on level 3. And hotel does not provide toothbrushes and toothpaste. Privacy was alright as guests usually mind their own business. For the cook lab, do note that there will always be guests there as my bf and i did not get a chance to prepare meals because some guests would often stay for hours with no consideration of others. Fridge is piled and full. Other than that the hosts were extremely helpful and answers all queries within a matter of time :) highly recommended."

"This is a capsule hotel so very small rooms and shared bathroom. However it__ very clean and convenient, comfortable, and in a good location. Overall very good value for area."

"I stayed here the last weekend of November. Before arrival I was told that the hotel was undergoing some construction - it was actually still under construction and was not finished while I stayed here, including the rooms.  My room's shower curtain was installed during my stay for example.

It's definitely setup to be a nice place to stay for travelers on a budget who want to be comfortable but don't really care about having a huge amount of space.

The first night I stayed in the room pictured with the upper bed - you must step up on the desk and then another ledge to climb up there, which I wasn't totally comfortable doing.  Once in the bed though, it was quite comfortable.  Unfortunately, I didn't get great sleep that night because there are gaps between the windows which let all of the noise in from the street outside.  In the morning I contacted the host to let them know about the issue, and that evening I was moved to another room with a lower bunk which faced the alley instead - this was much better.

I'd have no problem staying here in the future once the construction is actually completed and some weather stripping is installed between the windows to prevent the outside noise from coming in, but would definitely book the lower bunk to avoid precariously climbing into the bed."
"Great location with plenty of great food options near CBD! 

Do take note of the climb up to the bed, hence might be not be convenient for some guests."
"Pleasant stay, convenient location,  good room design, with sufficient space! Good for couples. AND i love the common area for cooking and etc. its even better than my own home haha"
Clean and modern design
"The space is just as you expect it to be in the pictures! Super trustworthy and fast communication on Airbnb. The services online for check in and check out is also reliable. They solved all my issues within 15 mins or so! If you are looking for a unique stay, this place is definitely what you are looking for. "
Awesome place
It was a cool place to stay. Kitchen amenities were also good. You can cook and etc. And also it was really cozy and clean
Really convenient location and room looks exactly like in the pictures. The kitchen is also really handy and the shared bathrooms in the hotel also looks really nice and clean
Its clean. Its comfy. There are alot of places to eat. The location is amazing.
The place look sleek and stylish . Many facilities are coshared. The room is cosy with a toilet. I like the rain shower as it helps us relax and wind down. It is good place if you like meet people in your co living space.
"A very cosy , peaceful and nice place indeed !"
Awesome place to stay. Will definitely come back again.

Super nice place and excellent service
"Good location , clean and full privacy"
"Great place to stay , good location and near town"
Nice and cosy plac to stay in. The room is very clean and location is good! Highly recommended if you are looking a place to stay.
"A lovely little space close to the city center. It can be your base for exploring the city or a calm little nook to hang out and chill. The staff is helpful and, while we didn't get to enjoy the amenities because of Covid restrictions, everything seemed great. Heartily recommended!"
"The place was clean and the service was friendly. Too bad they didn't do the breakfast anymore due to covid19. The only thing that bothered me was that it smelled a bit like cigarettes(?) unsure, you could only smell it if you were entering the room (so near the door) but it's probably due to the prior visitor who stayed for longer."
"Just one word - amazing!  from the location to the space itself. All that I was looking for, and then some. Great trip!"
Great so far
very nice place suitable for couples
"Great,quiet and clean environment to stay in."
"Located centrally and easily accessible! Apartment__ well equipped, clean and spacious!"
Awesome. Spotless. All clean and all is in great working condition!! Bathtub is a huge plus! _ºï_
Great location and service.
Great value and great place to stay. We thoroughly enjoyed the cleanliness and the amenities. The location was also wonderful.
"The host__ responses were quick and answered any of my queries. The place is spacious and good for couples who just wanna have a place to chill for few days. The bathtub, AMAZING!!!! My stay was wonderful and everything just went smoothly without any hiccups. Thank you so much for the wonderful service received."
"The place is as shown on the picture. A service apartment with complete amenities and very self sufficient. A small functional gym and small pool for waddling in. Excellent location and good communication prior to the stay. 

Only a minor glitch is that the glass door in the shower does not shut completely and water from the shower keeps soaking the rest of the toilet. But staff was quick to bring extra floor towels on request. Other than that. The TV is also a bit dated with image having lines on it.. and can__ Apple play or cast with android phone.. but these will be icing on the cakes as it__ getting more common in the newer hotels and apartments."

"I stayed in this apartment for 4 days, being my last few days in Singapore, after I moved out of my apartment of five years and before taking my final flight to return home to Australia. My first reaction was that it would have been a great apartment to rent during my five years in Singapore with all the amenities included or on hand nearby that I would have needed.  It immediately felt like home. 

It was spotless, and very bright - which matters to me - as well as private and relatively quiet.  The unit I was in (and there may be others available in this boutique condo, I am not sure) was on the fifth floor (the top floor) and at the back, away from the main road. Other units may be not so bright and noisier. But mine was excellent. 

The apartment is very well appointed (as advertised) with fully functioning kitchen, washer dryer, a/c, wifi, and a small gym and pool on site as well.  My apartment came with walk in shower and stand alone bath. 

The fact it is a serviced apartment and not just a private apartment like most Air BnB places is a plus ... and was a surprise to me. The __ousekeeping_ assistance is a nice extra - changing towels and linens and so on - every few days.

The local area - Novena - is an inner suburb, and just about on the edge of the  central district. While it has a suburban feel - less buzzy than some more central districts, say - it has all the amenities required in two local malls, plus an MRT station and excellent access to anywhere in Singapore. (I took a taxi to MBS in 10 minutes, for example.). 

All in all, an excellent apartment in a great location."
Beautiful condo and definitely recommend for anyone looking for a place to relax. :) thank you for your hospitality!
"Great host, amazing place and a view to complete the experience."
Great place for a getaway. Suffice space to cook and enjoy the space
Nice place
Amazing place! Love the bathtub with clear glass ceiling that allows natural sunlight to enter the bathroom. It was my birthday and staff has arrange a surprise birthday cake with balloons for me as well! Great experience will be back again :)
"Maarten__ apartment is luxurious, very clean, comfy and perfectly located ( within short walking distance from orchard road). 
The place is easy to find and the check in instruction is very clear. 
Maarten replies promptly and always ready to help. He even helped us to print our concert tickets! 
Recommended!"
"Maarten was a great host and very responsive to all questions pre and during our trip in Singapore.  The apartment was exceptionally clean with all the modern appliances and furnishings.  The apartment was actually one of the highlights on our trip.  The location is ideal and less than a 10-minute walk to Orchard Road (shopping and dining for days!!!).  My family and I will definitely miss the apartment with all the great amenities (fitness center and pool) including the friendly concierge and guards at the front gate of secluded property.
I highly recommend Maarten__ property when visiting Singapore."
"Perfect place, perfect host and very recomended"
The apartment itself looks exactly like the photos described - it__ very spacious and clean. Location wise it__ only 5-10 minutes walk to orchard road so extremely convenient. Maarten was a very responsive host and made the whole experience very seamless. Will definitely recommend
"Clean and spacious apartment with access to a lovely pool and gym, as well as a concierge service when available. The host is absolutely lovely and responds well to messages, enquiries and requests. It was a great stay."
"Maarteen place is great all things nearby.
Very helpful guest"
"Great location for a luxurious urban escape. Joanne and Maarten were very accommodating, allowing flexibility with our check in and check out times and providing extra amenities for our baby. They were also efficient and helpful in their communication. The large pool was a bonus! We enjoyed our comfortable stay -- thank you both."
This place is fantastic! A luxury retreat in the heart of Singapore a short stroll away from the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road. Beautiful modern apartment with all the luxury you can ask for. Why would you ever want to stay in a hotel if you can stay here? Fully equipped condo including amenities like a gym and a lap pool. Great and helpful hosts. I will definitely come back!
Conducive as a workplace. Quiet environment and neighborhood. A little thing to note that there is no television if it is one of your main source of entertainment.
"Maarten is the best host I ever had on Airbnb, he responded fast and offered me lots of help during the outbreak! I would recommend for anyone coming to Singapore !"
Maarten__ place is even more beautiful than the pictures. The amenities were amazing and the location is really close to orchard road which makes everything very convenient
"The place is sparkling clean and literally look the same like in the pictures. Check in and check out was easy and flexible. It comes with pool and gym and you wouldn__ feel that you__e in Singapore, perfect for a staycation and with the family! Thank you for hosting! 5 stars!"
"I stayed here for nearly a month and had a fantastic experience. Some highlights not covered in other reviews include:
-Great views of CBD/MBS from the 14th floor terrace
-Nice steam sauna in the unit itself
-High quality appliances 
-Resort atmosphere

The location itself is quiet, but near the major malls on Orchard road. Maarten was very kind and responsive, and I would absolutely stay here again. Recommended for both short-term or extended stays."
Jay's place far surpassed my expectations!
"Great place, great amenities, great location. Caroline was a fantastic host, with quick responses that helped facilitated the whole process. Overall a good experience."
"The place is very clean, sleek and modern, airy and bright. All amenities you need are in place. The host is great and response fast. The apartment neighborhood is private yet very strategic and easy to travel around using public transportation or taxi. I absolutely recommend this place and really like to come again next time."
Wir hatten einen fantastischen Aufenthalt.  Alles hat supper funktioniert. Die Kommunikation war sehr einfach mit Caroline. Die Lage ist sehr gut. Die Wohnung sauber und sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Absolut empfehlenswert. Vielen herzlichen Dank Caroline. :)

"The entire accommodation is not as new as pictures also there are ants everywhere. The host try to fix the problem and reply the message immediately. 
Location is very close to bus stop which go to main tourist spots and metro station is 10-15 minutes walking distance."
The apartment is a good size. I would ONLY recommend for young and able visitors who can walk & run and also sleep very well in the night. There's noise around in the nights.
Great place for a short getaway
"Great location, comfortable and fair price."
Easy to check in
Very cozy and clean place and i had a pleasant stay
Awsome place

"A perfect place to stay if you need to stay close to the university. Every place I visited was one bus ride away from this place. The whole apartment, not just the room, is spacious and clean and looks very trendy. Aglyn and Rae are super friendly and they had great suggestions regarding the touristy things I wanted to do in Singapore. Cannot recommend this place enough!"
"Nice decor. Overall, a pleasant stay"
"Aglyn is super host.. the apartment is very nice in term of location, cleanliness, amenities,, the room is very clean , bathroom is big and clean , the bathrooms amenities are branded.. absolutely will comeback to stay in Aglyn house"
"Nice place, Nice people"
Beware that the host may be very aggressive and unfriendly. And to inform her if u are going to organise parties as she will also demand u to pay if u do break any items.
Had a very comfortable and pleasant stay at this place.
"Aglyn is a beautiful person to begin with and has an extremely comfortable home! She really made us feel like we were a part of the place, it was a great experience. 

Definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to be in a home and not a house for a few days or even just a getaway, will be back surely! Thanks Aglyn! xx"
More than imagined
Aglyn__ place is beatifully crafted to make a cozy space in the middle of bustling Singapore
"This place is near to the block 610 bus stop and all the attraction places are very much nearby.

The host was friendly and helped us in every possible way.

This place is a treat to your money."

Cozy and clean place to stay. Beautifully set up. All possible amenities available. Great host.
"The place has modern design, from lights, faucets, interiors and and other stuff, free coffee too. Recommend place to stay. Friendly host and fast replies. Godbless your place!"
"Clean, tidy house and room. Everything is as depicted in the photos. Room is comfortable for 1 and a little cramp for 2 though it's manageable. The appartment is next to a highway so you can hear a constant slight buzz but I had no issues as there are double windows in the room. Hosts were friendly though we rarely bumped into one another (feels like you are alone in the house so lots of privacy)."
"beautiful place to stay! it__ so warm & comfortable. amazing hospitality, i had a great experience :)"
love the place ! stylish and spacious! quite place !
The place as a whole is so artistic and very clean. Quiet ambience and a very refreshing look it has. The host is very friendly and understanding. I'am definitely coming back here again!!
"Wonderful hospitality and cosy home. Feel free to approach Aglyn for any tips on where to eat or where to go for a good time for you stay in Singapore, really hospitable and clean space (:"
"Very calm and good place to relax, no disturbance"
Highly recommended. The place is way better than expected. Its clean and the whole apartment itself is comfy. Something out of the ordinary. The best I've seen by far. Host was very friendly and even tour us around even if its a short one. Service is way better than hotel.

"Nice and clean room, very homely place and near to the mall. The host Aglyn is very accommodating"
Nice place to have vacation.
THIS PLACE IS SO LITT! One of the best room ever! Spacious and the room is just so nice and aesthetic! The host really puts the extra effort to make us feel comfortable and it is a total overkill! Thank you!
Is a affordable and comfortable place to stay at.. highly recommended!!
Awesome master bedroom! 
Host is very friendly and talented in design. Stylish room near to shopping centre and bus stops.  Enjoyed my stay here
"Stylishly designed and modern apartment. Aglyn__ place is clean and welcoming; it isn__ hard to find and is close to a shopping mall, as well as a food centre. The room is very comfortable and temperature is perfect for a getaway from Singapore__ humid environment. She is friendly and quick to answer any queries we had. We enjoyed our stay here very much and would love to visit again. Definitely recommended!"
"Room is nice and clean.  Aglyn and other tenants are very easy-going.  Mall and hawkers are close by.  It__ a great experience, overall."
Lovely place for a good relaxing time. Deco and artwork in the room was a highlight
Very good! 5/5
"Classy, clean, and comfortable! The check-in was smooth too."
Value and worth. A really nice place and surely we will be returning again!
Great host

"If you want a place to stay that is close to the best form of transport in Sinapore (the MRT) with a gym and a very nice pool then this is the place. 

The room here was very nice with a balcony, air con, towels, toilet roll shower gel and shampoo provided. 

The kitchen is a bit dirty and there was no cutlery to use but that's ok if you're going to wat out every day. We tried to save money while we were here and cooked which maybe isnt what guests here usually do. 

The bathroom is also fine and the shower is great but maybe also a bit dirty. 

You are sharing the condo with other people some of which are a little bit rude but it doesnt impact your stay here if too much as you hardly see them.

Your host Jerry is extremely welcoming, he picked us up from the MRT station nearby and showed us around. He was always quick to answer any questions we had and was very helpful in providing things for us if we needed them.

Overall the place is great to stay if you aren't bothered about cooking for yourself and you just want a place to stay, relax by the pool and easily get into the main areas in Singapore for food and to see the attractions."

"Our stay was a bit frustrating. I was given the wrong address at check in, and the apartment smelled of cigarette smoke upon arrival. The housekeeper had not been thorough, and I cleaned several things myself. The apartment itself is modern and nice. The linens/furniture are sub-par. The property amenities and the location (just off the MRT) made up for the cons for us, but I would not choose to stay here again. The 4th floor pool, gym, grill area is fantastic. Guests should know that they will only receive 1 key. The table only has chairs for 2 to sit, and the sofa bed should only be used for children, and it is hard with a ridge in the middle. The host did try to remedy the issues we had, but it wasn't worth it for me to attempt to stay here again."
"I LOVED Wong's place! Best hospitality. The host not only stayed up until after 1AM to make sure I was checked in, they also provided me with breakfast when I had to stay in the house all morning working. The location of the condo was awesome and extremely close to MRT and shops/supermarket. We had many nice chats about life & laughed a LOT. Such a lovely couple! Highly recommend."
"Host does not stay at the place.
Two bathrooms on share basis.
Good location in good locality."
"Angela was a very good host, she gave us lots of good tips for visiting the city which were really welcomed. 
The room in the apartment was good value and in a nice block, easy to get around the city."
Great place to stay.
good
A cost-effective option
I am so so so touched with how Cheng actually could accomodate to my exception request for a birthday surprise. She totally make me feel super welcomed with her texts and help for the whole stay. Easy check in no hassle at all. I am more than delighted. Will come back for sure.
Great place to stay a bit different than the usual B&B. Cheng was a delightful hostess.

"Very near to Clark quay. With cold storage supermarket, starbucks and 7/11 right outside the condo. Large lap pool. Quiet and secure neighborhood. Basic needs and amenities were provided. Spacious."
"Perfect in every way! Super responsive host. Great views, large room."
Jing was very responsive. She met us during check-in and ensured that the listing was well prepared for my family and I. The view of the listing was awesome and the room was spacious.
"Jing Ã© muito eficiente nas respostas. Tirou todas as dÃºvidas e o apartamento nÃ£o poderia ser melhor. Ela tem reserva VIP ou seja, tem reserva anual no Hotel Marina Sands e Ã© relocado para nÃ³s. Fomos em quatro adultos. Reservamos dois apartamentos: um no andar trinta e um e outro quarto no andar quinze. A vista Ã© exatamento como nas fotos. Ela nos envia via (Hidden by Airbnb) algumas fotos e video e a comunicaÃ§Ã£o Ã© muito rÃ¡pida, sempre respeitando o fuso horÃ¡rio do local.  Tem acesso a piscina com borda infinita e ao mirante quantas vezes que quiser... NÃ£o estÃ¡ incluso cafÃ© da manhÃ£ que pago a parte custa 53 dÃ³lares por pessoa. Preferimos tomar cafÃ© da manhÃ£ no Mc CafÃ© que fica no Parque SuperTree que fica alguns metros ao lado do hotel. Toda parte turistica de Singapura fica ao redor do hotel. SÃ³ a Ilha Sentosa fica um pouco mais distante. _ um pouco caro mas vale a pena ficar um dia e aproveitar tambÃ©m a beleza do parque _ noite."
Such a great host and very accommodating to all our needs! Will definitely come back for sure! Place is just as described and my fiancÃ© and I had such a great time enjoying the amazing facilities here :)
Jing is a great host. She ensures she is there personally to help with check in. It was great meeting her!
"Jing was really helpful and responsive. Due to local regulations, we had to postpone multiple occasions but Jing was very patient and helpful, which made the experience very assuring. We had a very spacious room with beautiful views of the bay area, and the facilities in the hotel were great too. Highly recommend this place! Thanks Jing!"
"My family and I truly enjoyed our staycation at Jing__ listing. There were some hiccups upon our arrival but she did her best to salvage the situation which I truly appreciate! Please note that due to covid, you__l need to prebook your pool session which is a bummer. Other than that, room was fantastic and the view is spectacular as we got the city view. 

One thing to note is that there isn't any complimentary parking if you're driving. We chose to do valet which cost about $23 for 2 nights and we could exit and enter multiple times. 

Nonetheless, Thank you Jing!"
"Stay was good but not outstanding taking the price into consideration.
Due to COVID, infinity pool was not accesible and fully booked, could have been cokmunicated earlier regarding this. Check in time was delayed 1.5hrs. Balcony area was poorly kempt. Room interior is lacklustre and electronics outdated."
Comfortable apartment
Great accommodation.
"Nisha is a communicative friendly and helpful person. The apartment is modern, clean and nice. I gladly recommend her place and hospitality."
"I love it so much!!!! I didn't expect the location would be this awesome. Close to the beach and cool places. It's easy from downtown as well..

And Nisha is such an awesome host!!
I'm so happy with her and her accommodations.
Very recommended!!"
"To make this short,  Michelle is awesome"
Great experience
The place is great. Great experience from the hotel to see the fireworks.
Great value! In a really convenient location too

Will visit again. Thank you"
"It was a good stay at Singapore.
Sue place was super peaceful and just 100 Meters to bus stop and 1 km to holland village mrt that__ just 10 mins of walk. There is also a shopping center near by just 5 mins walk where you can get daily needs. If you like to cook there is beautiful kitchen with all the equipment__. Overall I will rate 10/10 for the stay."
Sue is wonderful host. She was so kind and generous
It__ a great place close to the university. It looks good from the outside and it__ a clean room with ac and a big comfortable bed. Would come back anytime!
Great stay! Could use the kitchen and porch outside. Bathroom was also very clean. Thanks Sue!
We had a wonderful day in Singapore! The place was quiet and comfortable. Yangxiao is the most thoughtful and graciuos host ever. He had everything I need in his home and was always there when we need help. He has been in Singapore for many years and can recommend you lots of places to have fun! I would definitely come again!

He provided me with all the information I needed, the place is just perfect. 

The bed is comfortable, bathroom and terrace are excellent. Many amenities located just a few minutes walk. Brandon_had excellent explanation and was of great help. He went way beyond to make my weekend stay comfortable and memorable.

Thanks_Brandon and_Woodlands_for a wonderful weekend!"

"Overall place and location is not bad. Need to touch up on furniture and cleanliness in the house. Host did not follow the time on the description for check in, was made to wait later than the given time to check in. Attitude towards guest is horrible, should brush up on customer service as the amount you are putting up is not cheap. I did not feel welcome from this host at all."
"The first guest for this room and it was an amazing experience! Songren and Renee were amazing and accommodating hosts that makes you feel a bit like home.

The room was accurate as the picture which is so nice and roomy. The king bed was comfy, decorations in the room was an added touch and you get to swim at their swimming pool!"
"Very clean, the family is incredibly nice, the place is very quite! Thanks to this wonderful family!"
"Songren and Renee had been good hosts and I enjoyed my stay there. It is a beautiful, tranquil place and perfect as a getaway from the hustle and bustle of city living. Thus this airbnb offers a unique experience in Singapore, not just expats but for locals to consider as well. Love it :)"
"This is a nice room with private bathroom in a very nice house. The neighbourhood is quiet. We really like the place and enjoy the stay. Songren and his mother are wonderful hosts, who provided lots of help when we travel with our baby."
"I had a very enjoyable stay with Songren and his family. During this covid-period, Songren and his family were very friendly and accommodating in making home away feel like home. I wish them all the best and look forward to seeing them again soon."

"Great location, so near to city central, and really lively and interesting locale! Love the pool!"
"Chrisrine ist eine super Gastgeberin, wir haben uns dort sehr wohl gefÃ¼hlt! Das Appartement ist klein aber fein und super sauber! Man genie_t die Nutzung eines eigenen Badezimmers und kann den sehr ansprechenden Ã¶ffentlichen Pool mitnutzen. Wir empfehlen diese Unterkunft weiter, von uns gibt es 5 Sterne (von 5 ;))."
"The place was good for our short stay of 1 night. The room is quite small but we expected it before we went. The place is clean and Chrisrine was super friendly. The newton food centre was super close by, only 5min walk. All in all, was a pleasant stay."
"Smooth check in, Alex came to open the door. Central location, easy access to everywhere. Very nice loft, brand new and super clean. The swimming pool and gym are plus."
"I was staying for around a week and I had a great pleasure to spend some time with Alex! Pool and gym came in handy, as well as huge shopping mall nearby with quality eateries on the 6th floor (there's a quick bite just across the road also). The place is not crowded at all and have nice parks around it, but it's in easy walking distance to Clarke's Quay Riverside vibes and a famous Zouk club. The atmosphere is quite laid-back, the flat is new and very clean, there is a big luggage room and all amenities you'll probably need. Most importantly, Alex is an amazing host that takes good care of his guests!"

"Perfect stay, perfect host, perfect location"
Everything was perfect during my stay at Alex__ place. The condo is very well located and the host Alex is very kind. You will not regret your stay with him.
"Check-in is made by a racing maze by a different entry throughout the basement upon little and poor comunicaton by the host.

Expect noise until midnight due to the constant slamming doors and the late owner__ activity, even he has stick rules on the main door.

You__l have to change the bed sheet and do the houkeeping yourself."
"Is my second stay at Alex__ place and I have no complains. The apartment has perfect location, 2min from Fort Canning park with beautiful big old trees, lots of shopping malls and commerce at walking distance, and yet in a quiet very nice residential area. The room is comfortable, fully equipped kitchen, washing machine, and cozy living room with view to the park. Alex is very kind and helpful, always making sure I had what I needed. I stayed here almost a month, and it felt very comfortable and peaceful."
One of the best and down to earth host ever meet . Recommend to anyone who loves living in the central.
"Great hospitality from host, space just nice for two people. Even though host was at home, no disturbance from host. Host was super responsive to any enquiries. Thanks for the amazing stay."
Booked but canceled last minute. Still haven't make any refund.
"Great host.
Great place to stay.
Near orchard rd.
Surely will come back again."
Friendly host who is very thoughtful and helpful along the way when you are not familiar  about the surroundings. Cozy house as well. Host will always check from time to time to see whether everything__ okay for you. Thank you Alex for hosting. Will be back one day again!
"Check in is smooth. Alex came to open the door. Perfect location, easy access to everywhere. The flat is brand new and super clean. The swimming pool is a plus."
100% the host was very nice
"Alex place was exactly as described in the photographs, very comfortable, stylish and neat. The location was the best as it was very close to the prime Orchard Road. The house was better than what was expected. If given a chance we would definitely want to stay here again. Thanks !!"

"Alex_ flat is very well situated near Dhaubi Gaut MRT Station. Any place in Singapore can be reached easily and fast from there. Using Grab as a taxi app even improves the situation. There even is a pool on the third level. I even found Wurst in the fridge, which was very surprising to me. I can only say thumbs up!"
"Incredible location, very nice host and great communication. Highly recommend"
"Big thanks to Alex, for helping people like us and giving space to stay in homely felling house.  He arranged everying considering guest requirement and need. All basic amenities ( Kitchen, AC,washing machine, bath, comfortable & clean bed, etc) and addition to this we are also getting swimming pool and gym. I would say his house is at one of the best location in Singapre as Mall, MRT,Graden,Bus stop,resturant is all  at walkable distance. Toursit/ visitors would be lucky if they get booking here as you won't get such nice room with all these amenities in this price.

Thanks again Alex !!  Cheers"
Alex is a wonderful host who became a friend over my stay. He helped me every way possible with his pleasant personality and made me feel at home right away. Highly recommend him!
"Great location, host is very helpful!"
I was looking for a place last minute at 1.30am and he got me in! Thanks 
"Alex is a very gentle, talkative and well-educated person. 
Facilities in the rooms are great. Perfect location."
"Just as described, no issues at all! Be a little bit flexible as the property is managed by the hotel, so it will come down mostly to the hotel flexibility on check-in and check-out times."
Nice and quiet location!
Love it
Great place to stay ..service was good too :)
"Hosts were accommodating, highly recommended place to stay at at an affordable rate. Literally clean and comfy! Thanks Carol. "
great price! convenient location
It was a recommendable place to stay in singapore. 
"Carolyn's place is very near the train station. The entire apartment is clean and bright, check in was a breeze too. My questions were promptly answered. I will book this BnB again. Thank u for making our stay such an enjoyable one :)"
A very good place to stay. Just near MRT and Yew Tee Square shopping mall. It was very neat and clean. Affordable also.
"The place is very accessible to the Yew Tee MRT station. Best place to stay if you want silence and the price is affordable. The place is very clean, the host were approachable.... Highly recommended."
"Carolyn's place is definitely value-for-money, clean, and quiet. Located just 2 mins away (by foot) from Yew Tee MRT station, her place is super convenient for travelers with bulky baggage. The room is as described: furnished minimalistically and air-conditioned.  The only downside is having to share the bathroom with others during the stay. Nevertheless, Carolyn's AirBnB is a gem in the North-West heartland in Singapore! Highly recommended to all!"
"This apartment was superb.. in quite area, easy to anywhere, closed to food heaven. Inside is super clean.. bathrooms are amazing, five stars really.. we are really happy in here.. great job.."
"Nirvana__ place is clean and comfortable to stay in. The host is really kind and quick in responding. The apartment is located in a quiet neighborhood, but is quite far from the MRT station. Overall, I had a really good experience staying here :)"
Highly recommended! 
Stayed for a bit over 2 weeks. One of the best Airbnbs I stayed in Singapore. This is more of a residential area. Host was helpful and accommodating.  I can recommend this location.
"This apartment is on the 7th floor, has large windows in every room with a beautiful view of the city skyline.  There are only 2 other residents on the same floor.  There are 2 elevators going to the ground level as well as the parking deck in the basement. There is plenty of light in the apartment but the blackout curtains can also be used.  It's a quiet neighborhood and a convenient location, only 2 blocks from the bus line and about a 10 min walk from a mall and MRT station.  There is a small grocery store around the corner and 7/11 stores nearby.  The apartment has 2 bedrooms.  There is a shower/bathroom ensuite for the master bedroom and then another shower/bathroom on the hall.  There is a small balcony, TV room, dining room, small kitchen and washroom.  A hair dryer, iron and ironing board are provided.  There is a washing machine and dryer and comes with all cleaning supplies plus paper towels, toilet paper, shampoo, soap, and coffee packets. The kitchen is small but has dishes, cutlery, a 4-burner stove top for cooking plus a few pots & pans. There is also a microwave, electric water kettle and large fridge.  The beds were firm and very comfortable.  The linens were sufficient with a duvet for each bed.  5 towels were provided plus several throw blankets.  The water pressure in the bathrooms was strong and the hot water was consistent.  Our contact via (Hidden by Airbnb) was quick to respond whenever we asked a question.  The location was convenient to Mt Elizabeth at Novena, Zhongshan Park and a (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) minute walk from Mustafa's Center.  We stayed for 1 month during the beginning of the COVID outbreak and were thankful to have a safe & convenient place to stay for our time in Singapore.  I would highly recommend this apartment to any traveler.   One word of caution for anyone with children would be related to the large windows that I enjoyed in every room.  There are no locks on the windows so it might be a concern for those with small children who could open those windows.  This will be a memorable stay for us due to the COVID pandemic that unfolded before our eyes."
"Nice location, easy to get to shopping center and market. Efficient communication with landlord when we need anything. Worth to stay will come back next time"
all was wonderful
Thank you!
"For 15 days stay in EC place, we really enjoy and comfort. thx"
"Every single night, there are a lot of people who use WiFi, so the network speed becomes very slow.

If you are heavy Netflix or Youtube user, please consider it again."
EC 's place is really nice place for a stay. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it for a young couple. It doesn't have a lift so if you have large luggage then it's a climb. But all in all it's a really nice place and we would return again.

"The apartment is very clean and spacious and the greeneries outside the balcony is beautiful. Location is superb!! Plaza Singapura (a big shopping mall) with the train station (at the basement of the mall), is only walking distance from the apartment. To the left you can also find a cinema. Very convenient to walk around. Vivi is very friendly and also helpful to my requests. Best choice of stay so far for me in Singapore!! Highly recommended!!"
Nice host great apartment
Host is friendly and very fast in replying message. Check-in & check-out process very smooth. Recommended! Will stay again next time
"Host refused to acknowledge fault and apologise despite being an hour late on check-in. Waited for an hour in the lobby and had to take a business call there as a result, was unable to reach her at all at check-in time. Pushed the blame to guest making a last minute booking request when complained, instead of finding ways to apologise and compensate."
Zen is a nice host with a nice accomodation
Convinient place with good price. Has lots of food around.
Nice place but a lot of insects.
"A must book, specially if you want your own space. They have a TV, dishwasher, and refrigerator,p. You can cook as well. Very spacious and definitely worth the price. They are also very accommodating and is approachable."

"Place is great, close to the cities and the host is friendly who accepts feedback with open mind."
"We__e thankful our host was able to inform us about the corona virus. However, our booking was cancelled one day before our trip, so there is really nothing to write a review about.. fortunately we were able to find a replacement, so we don__ blame the host :)"

"Really helpful host, ask him questions and he will respond with great help. 

The location is very convenient.  Walking distance to Bugis+ (less than 10 mins walk) and Plaza Singapora (10 mins walk).  Also has a very close by food court (next to Peace Centre). 

Facility is awesome, got its own gym (open from 6am to 10pm) with 2 treadmills and some weight lifting equipment.  Also has a nice children playground and a large swimming pool plus children__ pool. 

Check in check out time is really flexible (as long as there is no back to back booking)... very easy going host. 

Will consider to stay here again in my next family trip."
"Zen cancelled my booking on the last minutes, what kind of review do you want me to write here?"
Daniel was quick with his response and the location was great! It was close to everything you need for a fuss free stay! The room was as advertised! Thank you once again!
Clean and cozy place to be in.
Awesome host and simple and nice place.
Very clean and cosy place.
"Cons:
1) Room was connecting with another main room via a door outside. Did not know if the other party had keys to our room and did not feel safe. 
2) Room was smaller than expected and crampy even for 2 or even 1.
3) Host mentioned cooking pot and pan provided for light cooking however mentioned that the previous guest had taken it (then they should replenish cause we paid the same amount). He only provided egg sized pan which honestly, couldnt cook anything besides eggs.
4) We asked for a bigger pan and host mentioned will get back to us but did not till we called back. Also, host asked us specifically what we were going to cook and my partner mentioned we were cooking instant noodles with egg and had to explain it was not the cup noodles. 
5) Kitchen was so small and crampy with washing machine, refrigerator, sink and cabinet all squeezed tgt. 
6) No TV in room.
7) No place to eat only a very small beside table and u could only sit on the bed to eat. 
8) Blinds were not very efficient in covering the outside passageway where ppl walk pass decreasing privacy.
9) No bidet. 
10) Windows were only at the bathroom which could only be half opened for ventilation and ppl outside could see inside. 
11) At the end of the stay, he mentioned that the remote controls were missing though I put it in the wardrobe (did not check thoroughly before asking). 
12) Hdb multi storey parking was slightly far. 
13) Too pricey for the small room and it should be mentioned as a room with kitchenette listing instead of a studio (ppl would expect a Studio to be bigger). 
Pros:
1) Good water pressure.
2) Good quality shampoo and body wash provided (the small bottles of shampoo and body wash are expired).
3) Good and comfortable bedding and pillows which could fall asleep right away.
4) Wardrobe provided large enough to hang clothes and put many things.
5) Entitled for slightly late check out.
6) Clean room.
7) Host did let us stay as I explained my personal reasons and I was really appreciative as he did have a prob with the previous guests who smoked in the room which he mentioned he reported to Airbnb. 
9) Near to NTUC from Condo's main entrance.
10) Overall, I would stay again if the price is lower for the small room and if host did install a TV as there is nothing else to do in the room. Host's hospitality is ok but there are no special touch in the room for that price."
Daniel's place is clean and he respect your privacy
Great stay! The place is spotless and check-in was seamless! Cosy and comfortable setting.
A beautiful apartment which is Super conveniently located at the Tiong Bahru neighbourhood with good cafes! :)
Cosy comfortable place for a weekend staycation of rest and relaxation. Nearby many delicious food options as well.
Good value and timely response
Very clean.
"Especially loved the location of the BnB. Filled with cafes, amenities, bars and public transportation nearby. Place is a dual-key unit, clean and accurate to pictures."
Small but cosy. Great host!
Clean and cosy place!
"Cosy place, light cooking possible as the kitchenette has an induction cooker, no tv in the place but you can bring your own laptop. Facilities like the Swimming pool and gym are nice to have around. Good for singles or couples only, the place is a studio apartment so don__ come in large groups. Smooth check in and host is helpful, will come and stay again!"
Excellent location

"Great cozy spot in Tiong Bahru, very near to the surrounding cafes and to the train"
Great location with an incredible host.
"It is a very special location for friends whom enjoy to explore different special coffee shop in Singapore.  Located in an old preserved area, quite center of Singapore , so everything there looks very interesting for foreigner.  Room very clean and new easy to access on ground floor and host will pass u the key in person.  Very friendly host to walk you and explain everything.  The bed is very comfy to have a good rest."
Excellent place to be!
Awesome hospitality
Excellent n highly recommended
"We have been stay Kate 'S place for one month already. Would like to say Kate is a most response with host and alwasys fast and meet our requirements.
Thanks Kate for providing the best service here. First experience in Airbnb.
Freda"
"Kate is a great host. She was very upfront with the pros and cons of her place. So I was making my selection of her property with my eyes open. Despite her warning me of the road noise, I have to admit if took me some getting used to as you can hear the sound of buses and cars from about 6 in the morning onwards. I do however have to admit after a few days it did not bother me as much.

Katie's place is exactly as advertised. It's clean and with good walking space. It's basically a two level split, where the lower level has a bed room and a shared hall and kitchen, and the upper level has its own bedroom and living space.

Location is good, with a quick walk to the MRT station and there is a ridiculous amount of food places within 1 minutes walking distance.

Forgot to add on one point. Kate is awesome when it comes to response time and getting things done. Told her I needed some cleaning and laundry powders etc and the next day all items were delivered. So a huge shout of thanks to a lovely host."
Nice Host and nice service. Enjoyed our stay
"The room is clean and comfortable. Surrounding environment is quite, there are park, supermarket, laundry and food court nearby, all within walking distance. Close to few MRT stations and shopping malls. Cindy and her family are very nice hosts, they are very caring and considerate. The overall experience is really satisfying. Just one suggestion: it will be great if the bedroom can have a thicker curtain to block the sunshine for the side windows."
"Cindy, it was my pleasure to stay at your place and I really enjoyed it. Looking forward to meet you some time in the future again.

Regards,
Manoj"
it's quite reasonable price and rooms.
"I can go anywhere easily using bus and mrt from this location, lots of foods and convinience store"
"It is such a nice apartment, we were happy to live here for 5 days. The apartment is the same in pictures, the bus station is near the house. We will come back if we go to Singapore"
"The bedroom door can__ open full and the place is smaller than i expected, the air conditioner had some problem on my second day, but the host resolve the problem immidiately"
"The apartment is very small- can fit comfortably 3-4 people but not >5 as it advertise. The rooms are very small, fit a bed and bearly have areas to walk around. The apartments are not very clean. Overall, very different from the photos."
Overall the experience is good. The place is surrounded by many food place so it__ easy to find food even for insomniac. But if you bring family be extra careful when bring child out at night to avoid seeing something they shouldn__. And Thank You Zen for the hospitality and hope i can enjoy dobhy ghuat next time
"This really is a wonderfull place, suitable when traveling with family or friends, near markets, supermarkets, bus stops and lots of delicious restaurants. I will come back here when I come to Singapore _"
"Quick response when asking questions.  

Spacious place.  Area is bit secluded and near red light district however it still very safe as it is a gated residential place.  Alot of food option nearby."
Alice's place very convenient. nearby has many restaurants and shops. Many available grab foods too. Friendly and helpful host
"We really enjoy our stay in the apt. Alice is a friendly host who always answer our questions asap.
The location is great with lots of convenient store and restaurant. Bus stop nearby. 
The apt is clean with all the amenities work perfectly. It really worth the price.Thanks for being such a great host

Alice has been a great host. The apartment is very well located and clean.
Thank Alice the place was better than we expect
Nice and cozy environment. Convenient

"Great house; great location; but it became inconvenient for me to live there for so many days with my parents and unable to use the stove to cook something light. The host was responding to every message quickly and very helpful except the part when I asked her about the stove. It was not working. Also might want to keep a toaster in the house for breakfast. Would be of great help for the guests  Other than that slight inconvenience, everything was great"
"Location was good but however the place was quite small and dusty. The  bedsheets were all crumbled and the doona was just left on the bed without its cover. Towels had an odour and felt unhygiene to use. There was no bathroom floor mat. Hot water keep coming on and off. No kitchen bin. The washing machine did not wash well too as it turned all the white clothes to grayish colour. Lastly, I wished there were bigger clothes rack and enough laundry area to dry the clothes."
There is very good place!
"Evangeline and Abi are the best hosts, always ready to help and with such cool vibes. They set you in the best mood to see Singapore!! The room has the best floor space i've seen in any hostel in 3 years of travelling with ample locker space and room to just move and relax. There's a cool common area for meals and I love the color scheme of the kitchen it's so statuesque. Good favorable location, near the mrt and with good eateries downstairs. In other words, book it already. Promise you won't regret it!!!"
"I__ come here again for Abi__ amazing hospitality! He was friendly and gave quick responses, the place is near to many amenities, and near the city!"
"quite place,comfortable,  with good service from abi and evangeline too!"
"Good for group or family traveller to save your money as budget travellers, strategic place because near with MRT and Bus station, and appreciate for the kindness of co-host (Mr.Abi)"
"This is a good place to rest and its right next to the mrt station, great food around the the area."
Great!!!
Best hosts ever!! Abi and Chen were the kindest and were very thoughtful.  They helped me on things that I needed even when it was already outside of their responsibility as hosts. The location was perfect too! Very close to an MRT station and you can easily get local food from hawkers and shops nearby. Will definitely book again when I visit Singapore again soon!
"It's a perfect  place for  back packers. I'm amazed how safe it was to stay in there. Not even a single  day did I lock my personal  items in the safe  & nobody touched them. Oh, unlimited  coffee & snacks are provided hehehe... for some of us who love munches. Suitable  location, saved me few $$$ since the mrt is around  the corner. Abi is one of a kind. 
Love from Kenya"
The room is not tidy.
"Host was really nice and always helpful. So the communication was good. We were a little bit surprised, that we only had a curtain which separated us from the living room. Also there could have been more bathrooms for that many people. Still we enjoyed our time there"
"Near MRT, Convenient transportation"
It's a reasonable place to stay at Kuala Lumpur
"The hostel is literally 3 minutes away from the MRT, which was perfect as I arrived late in the evening. The place is very clean and well thought off. The kitchen is welcoming. The bedlinen is good quality. There are a lot of small details that show that they have thought about the comfort of the guests. A breakfast is included, which makes the place even more great value. I would come back again."
Perfect place for group traveling
"I love the place! Although I booked it for my friend, I wish I stayed there! The place is so homey and the host is very friendly! She helped us throughout the stay! Hope to stay in again! "
"Abi is a very responsive and pleasant host and provided a clean bedroom during our stay. The room itself is very sunny and comfortable for stay for upto 8 people. It is at very strategic location next to MRT. Great for family/solo traveler who needs a space to travel/experience SG and need space to sleep and take bath, nothing more - nothing less than what you see in photos. His prices were also reasonable and Abi is truly a gentleman and we hope he acquire more wealth to get more and better hostels to host."
Good place with a restaurant downstairs for convenience. Pretty close to some overall good spots in the city.
"We would not recommend this place and/or company. 
1. We did not get the room we paid for (we paid for a studio king room, and we got a studio queen - which is cheaper and smaller)
2. We got the worst check out experience, we gave a deposit and the person that had the money arrived 2 hours later. He was super rude with us, saying that ""it wasn't his problem"" because according to him we extended our stay (if they were organized, they knew about our stay dates)
3. Don't rely on the shuttle bus service, no one explains how it works.
4. The card was not working (we didn't have power), we called and messaged the host and never replied (even though they have an emergency contact number)"

"Stayed there for 2 months and I regret it. First of all, pictures are very deceiving. Rooms are much smaller than they appear to be in the pictures. People are noisy and you can hear everything in the corridor as if you were in a dorm. Location is very isolated with no conveniences close by (except one cheap restaurant and vending machines downstairs) and far from the metro (1km). Appliances are crap. Had to ask for a proper iron. First one caused my electricity to shut down and had to wait ages to get power. Fridges are bad and freezer does not freeze well and ice builds up very quickly. Room should at least have a toaster and microwave! 

The only good thing were the staff. Very good attitude and all but the cleaning was a bit sloppy.  Laundry provided by staff once a week. No washing machine in the rooms."

A no-frills place with far away amenities and don't forget your walking shoes! Lots of walking involved.
"The place is exactly as advertised. Highly recommend it to solo travellers who are on a budget.  

Pros: 
+ Can do simple cooking on a induction cooktop
+Free-to-use washing machine and dryer, both are working wonderfully
+Most of the time the place is very quiet 
+Exceptional fast and free WiFi 
+Common area are regularly cleaned but not sure of the frequencies 
+ 3 mins walk to a 7/11 store which opens 24/7, next to the 7/11 is a budget tool store that sells almost everything one might need for daily life.
+ Never short of food options around you. Tiong Bahru offers a lot of food options, all within walking distance from the place 

Cons: (personally I don't consider some of the things I have listed as cons but others may do so)

- the nearest mrt is 8-10mins walking distance away. However, if you don't like walking, there is a bus stop right in front of the place, from which you can take bus to the mrt. 

- No views at all and curtains need to be drawn at all time. 
Having a window is nice but don't expect to have any views. The only thing you can see is the rooftop of the property at the first floor and the windows of other rooms.

However, if your room is located at the street-facing side, you may get a street view. 

- Very rarely you may experience power shutdown but no worries as power is usually back on within minutes.

- No social areas and tenants are all kept to themselves"

Really cozy nice and neat house located in convenient place.
It a very calm neighbourhood. You will get what you pay. Overall it__ a average place to stay.
"Clean, quiet corner and value for money!"
Good host and sparkling clean place!
Clean and comfortable room. Friendly family with a cheerful atmosphere. Place is slightly far from city centre but the acess is still convenient with public transport. Host is helpful as well.
"Really great place to stay if you don't mind being some ways out of the main downtown area and tourist attractions.  It's about a 45 minute to 1 hour ride using public transportation.  William and his family were great hosts, someone was also available to help me and the entire home is sparkling clean.  William has a young son that at times would get excited and shout, like young kids do, but the family always did a great job of calming him down and did their best to respect quiet times of the day.  I highly recommend staying with William if you want to have a more authentic local experience outside of the main tourist areas and don't mind a longer travel time home."
Amazing
"Such a unique experience and a much needed ""holiday"" for us.  Jo + Lionel are wonderful hosts. Accommodation well-maintained and clean. Spacious and plenty of headroom. Complimentary drystores and plenty of drinks (at very minimal prices) in the wine chiller+fridge. Fridge has plenty of space for guests' own items as well. Toilet was also more spacious than usually expected on a boat. Boat's audio system able to sync via bluetooth and thoughtful of them to provide iPhone MHL cables for the TV as well. All in all, recommended stay."
Met up Jo and he explain clearly. Was unexpected that it was just amazing . Thank you !
Great getaway

"Jian's place is located at newly condominium in a suburb, about ~5 minutes walk to the Lakeside station or take 3 bus stop ride to Chinese Garden station from condo exit. The bedroom enough, bathroom outside really clean, share living room, kitchen, balcony,... extremely good, Jian has everything you need. It's convenient and comfortable, I enjoyed my stay at your house so much. However, the condo really far from airport and city hall, about 1,5 hours to reached airport. It's oke la, nothing bad right. Friendly host, neighborhood nice. Lovely ^^"
"Juan__ place is a tiny room, but you definitely have what you need.
It is worth the stay.

The location is perfect for unwinding. So relaxing with big giant swimming pool right near you. 

Public transport is very close. Where the train station is just 7 minutes away and the bus stop is just next to the building.

Walking distant to hawker places, where there are plenty of choices to eat delicious food.

Thank you so much for your hospitality. 

See you again sometimes."

"Great location! Probably the best in Singapore! Nice, clean, friendly host. 
Highly recommend."
"Lucinda was an excellent host and provided all the necessary instructions for a smooth check in. She was helpful and patient in answering my queries. Location of the apartment is convenient, with many food places in the vicinity. Bugis Junction Shopping Mall is a 2 minute walk away and there are convenience stores and supermarket nearby. My room was very clean and comfortable with basic amenities such as towels and hair dryer provided. Highly recommended and I hope to stay at Lucinda's apartment again in the near future."
Perfect location! Super clean and cosy apartment. Highly recommend this place to others
"I stayed at Lucinda's place for a weekend. Knowing that I wouldn't spend too much time at the Airbnb, the location for the price is awesome. It's a quick, easy, and safe walk to Bugis station, Liang Seah Street (quite happening at night), or Arab Street (cheap and delicious murtabak!). Lucinda met me during check in to show me the space. The washer is really nice to have but you'll need to time your use with it and the bathroom right since the place is shared with 4 or so other rooms. The internet for a video/work call was rather spotty but that is an easy fix. I appreciated the water bottles/glasses in my room especially after the hot days as well as the extra outlet converter."
"I stayed here solo 3 nights on a trip to Singapore and had a lovely stay. Walking distance to major attractions, very clean and comfortable room. Would definitely recommend this place to other travellers!"
Very well located and convenient for visiting! Lucinda offers a sweet little room in the heart of Singapore.
"Lucinda very nice!
and bugis great location, 
that's about it"
Lucinda was a nice host with great and kind hospitality. The apartment is located in the center so everything is easy to reach
"Lucy was such an amazing host with fast communication, she personally gives you a tour of the place and hands you the keycard upon check in. The location was superb near lots shopping malls, a 2 minute walk from the MRT and Conveniently located near a multiple bus stops. Lucy was also really nice about letting me leave my luggage at the place for my late flight. Would definitely recommend and would definitely book her place again the next time I am in Singapore."
"Lucinda's apartment is situated in an extremely convenient location that is 2-3 minutes away from a shopping mall and train station. She was friendly, helpful and responsive to all my queries. I look forward to staying at her place again soon. Thank you!"
"Great location,  responsible and friendly  host. Highly recommending to other the guests."
"Good location, nearby to many restaurants and very near to bugis mall. 
Very friendly host"
Nice stay
"Cosy, convenient and friendly host :) Would come back to stay again. Love the minimalistic styled room."

"Advarsel. Intet i annoncen passer. Billederne er mange Ã¥r gamle. Alt er meget slidt. Sofa er gammel og ulÃ¦kker. Brusekabine pÃ¥ badevÃ¦relse er i stykker. Alt er uhumsk. Ville have os til at skrive under pÃ¥ en lejekontrakt, hvor lejeperioden var pÃ¥ 3 mÃ¥neder. Det er ulovligt i Singapore!!!"
"I would absolutely recommend this flat to anyone. It's a great, modern flat and layout for a family. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are great. It's so nice that they come in and empty the garbage, make the beds, change the towels and clean the bathroom every day! Catherine, Grace and everyone else there were so responsive and helpful. We loved having an instant hot and cold water machine. There are all sorts of things such as coffee makers and toasters available if you would like. Catherine and her staff were very accommodating. I can't recommend Catherine's place enough!"

"Great location easy travel by bus or mrt station and all furniture in room very new feel like new home, have good staycation here "
It__ at least a 15 minute walk to the MRT station. The sheets smelt like fried food.

"After almost a month in this Abnb  here what you__l expect:

The good

Outside the center
10min from the supermarkets
Lift
5min from the bus stop
30 min from the airport
20min from the beach

The bad

45 min from the center

The uggly

The neighbor will start the shambling at 23:30 until 1 am(including shower, banging wall and doors etc...)

There__ more noise during the night

The other guests usually have 6 showers a day 2 during the night around 2am and 3am.

Most of them are uneducated and dirty(no for the showers)

Reporting them to the host will have no impact(as the rest you guess) as they will be checked in right away the next week, you won__ believe it!

Slamming doors 24/7

Rooms 1&2 will be exposed:

to the noise of the mechanic portal, activated around 2-3am.
The garage-gate activated a couple of minutes after the portal."
"just. Ok.
No TV  in room.

"Amazing place especially if you'd like to put some great pictures on your (Hidden by Airbnb) .
Location is good too. Shops, cafes and MRT are in several minutes away.
However balance between design and comfort is on the design side. Some small things like aircon directed at your head or absence of the roof in the shower. (Yep, looks nice, but a bit cold at night and I'm not sure if I'd enjoy it during the rain)
Host was super helpful and responsive.

To sum up it's the best place I stayed in Asia so far."
"Guys this place is great! We stayed there for a month.
The house is amazing-  new, well decorated with everything you may need.  Huge kitchen, fantastic living room where you can just cook, chill and hang out with the other tenants. 
We stayed in the master bedroom which was by far the best room in the house - which private bathroom and open sky shower which makes you feel like you are staying in a 5-star hotel in Bali. 
Fang and the team were the best in terms of communication and service - immediate response and comprehensive maintenance services. 
You will not belive how cool is this place - authentic renovated Shophuouse that provides the perfect combination between old and new. Unfortunately, the pictures don't represent the beauty of this place but trust me it is fantastic co-living space with unique opportunities to meet new people"
Lovely host! Strategic place and worth to stay. Highly recommended to all.
"One of the best places I__e stayed in Singapore. Really nice host. Peaceful neighbourhood. Very calm and nice didn__ even realised that we stayed in busy Singapore. If you__e an avgeek this place is amazing. Military flights are always there. So it__l be a great experience.

Kitchen is good and possible to do some cooking, although food in Singapore is great. Check in was very fluent and communication with the host was great."
"The room is little, but very bright and clean. The view is really cool! You also have a terrace (unfortunately without chairs). 

Area is really cool and famous, recommended to explore. It's very quiet. Bus stop in 5-10 minutes walk. 

I like your place, would recommend it to my friends! Thank you to host us!!!"
Thank you for hosting!
Felt like home and comfy. Love it so much stayed in this house for 3 night.
A cosy and comfortable place to stay at. Hosts are super nice.
Quick response and very clean. Thank you for your hospitality. Will definitely come back.
Well recameonded
Nice place to stay.
Great stay and hassle free
"quiet and clean room, nice place to stay. well recommended."
Awesome!
"Stay was located at a quiet neighbourhood of Katong. Eateries were within 10 minutes walk. Check in was fuss free. Room was a little small and basic as per previous comments. 

Room for improvements were the pillows. The foam pillows felt like very old pillows which were very flat and soft. Had a bad neck and shoulder ache using the pillows."
Nice location
"Value for money, clean and tidy"
"Great location! Love that the place is so accessible to town, east coast park and old airport road eateries! Good getaway for Singaporean westies!!"
We really enjoyed the balcony. Ambiance from there is very relaxing. Clean and quiet place.
Nice
Place is really neat & clean ! Near to shops too . Balcony view so nice . Really worth the price ! Recommended to whoever wanna book this place ! _¤ï__¤ï_
Great cosy place

"The place is close to Vivo City. There__ only 1 place to eat downstairs and no minimarket nearby. But there__ a fridge in the room and electric stove also microwave so you can stock up your food in the room. The wall is a bit thin because you can hear the baby cried from room number 1 meanwhile you are in room number 9. the room was clean, the ac worked perfectly, the heater also worked very well."
Everything was ok. The bed was a bit old & used. But overall it was a acceptable staying.
Not Good....Booked for three days but host didnt attend or contact to us...self check in and no cleaning in three days...

"Nice place and a very convenient location, close to bussess, MRT and bars. Very quiet and green. The restaurant downstairs serves really delicious and affordable meals. Laundry and housekeeping is included. The coffee machine downstairs has great coffee , much better than many cafes (!)"
It's a lovely place to stay. Thank you!
"The place is very nice in the heart of China Town. 5 min walk to go public transportation (MRT)  

It's nice so close the door of the pod so you have your own privacy. There are lockers, for this you don't need to bring your lock with you. 

The hostel is very quiet, even in the morning. There is no kitchen and there is not a really big place to sit and meet people. That was a disadvantages for me. 

AC is in the rooms!"
"""Ok"" hostel amenities. Nice if you want to try the pods, but that's all. Location is good and communication is great."
"A great place with parking place!  For those who driving in singapore,  may consider this premis!"

Only downside is the MRT is not within walking distance for us, family travelling with small children but we mostly travel by taxi anyway, due to taxi being more time efficient.  We really liked it there."
This unit is not all functional at first but it's located in a good neighborhood and convenient spot with lots of food options.

Cancelled last minute - one day prior our stay! Very annoying :(
The picture on the listing was deceiving. The place I stayed at was much smaller than the image so take this into consideration for the price.

"The place is a great spot, it's a bit of a walk to the station. But I didn't take any trains to get anywhere during my weekend in Singapore. I was more than happy to walk to most places. The room I stayed in was a slightly smaller one shown in the pictures, but it was still enough for me to clean up and sleep. However, the one thing to note is that noise control is a bit hard and reminded me of the noise you get in a University dorm, so you can hear people walking by the door and other people's music and TV as long as their door is open. Overall I would still come back to stay though."
Good value for money.

Clean and comfortable condo near Holland Village! Everything was exactly as described. Would be happy to stay here again next time we__e in Singapore!
"Very clean and stylish apartment. Located near town. There is a bus stop in front of the apartment, so getting to town, Holland Village, or MRT station is easy."
"very comfortable, clean condo, we have a pleasure time."
Great stay within a 15 minute walk to Holland village or a 5 minute bus ride (only 2 stops). The team was great and immediately answered any questions that I had. I would definitely stay here again.
"Hannah__ place was a true home away from home. It was super clean, bright and convenient. The balcony was a plus. Highly recommended."
Stayed here for 4 nights. Place is as per photo shown. Nice ambiance. Have a nice balcony with chairs and coffee table. Location is just 15 mins on bus to Orchard Road and and located just next to a bus stop. Hannah was in top of things when you need information. Dempsey hill is just a short walk from this property.
Very cozy place!
"The place is wonderful from start to end! Clean, comfy and cozy space which is perfect for couples. The neighborhood is quiet as well, and we had maximum privacy during our stay which is fantastic. If given the chance again, I would definitely choose to stay here again."
"Great place, great location, really clean and tidy!

Only thing to note is it's not a studio apartment, it's a locked room in a larger house with shared bathroom and kitchen - all clean and tidy but the shower is a not very powerful.

Would stay here again though."
"The house you will be staying in is design magazine pretty. I dig why they aren__ letting people photo shoot in there.

You have to understand that this isn__ a full place you are renting but a room. It__ indicated in the description but not in Airbnb search filters. What this means is you will have several flat mate. Everyone we met was nice and charming. 

I took one star out because of the bathroom / shower situation. The bathroom has a super wet floor our entire stay. There was no carpet / towels in sight but our individual one to clean up the problem and no shower curtain to prevent splashing. You get maybe 5-10 people sharing one bathroom for one week and it gets yucky. 


Other than that great location super design place and the bedding is really comfortable."
Love the place! Thank you for hosting :)
"Gorgeous boutique hotel. Fantastic location, super clean, friendly staff. Would recommend."
"Amazing place, host and staff! Friendly and quick to assist!"
"Very secure, quiet and near many small hip joints. Great food inside the hotel, drinks complimentary and the rooms were small but perfect. The private tub was a luxury."
Amazing atmosphere and very clean. Great value for money. Room was cozy and amenities were great. Will definitely comeback in future!
A recommended place.
Nice and cosy! Would come back again ;)
"Great getaway in a tropical oasis along Keong Saik Road! You'll be spoiled for choice when it comes to food so the location is fantastic. Good effort for the brekkie though it wasn't the best, save your calories for better food around the area. Otherwise, love the 24/7 free flow drinks, the 2 free instant noodles and 2 cans of tiger beer. What would have made this place better is a pool; but luckily the outdoor tub kinda makes up for it. Bring a swimsuit for modesty purposes. 

P.s very very comfy beds. Enjoyed our staycation getaway"
Very pretty & cozy place!
"A great pleasure staying at the hotel. 
Employees were very friendly and hospitable  Would come again!"
Amazing view and location..
Great accommodation if you are a business traveler. Sparkling clean with basic amenities in room that would be great I'd you are visiting Singapore for work.
"Beautifully appointed room that is cleaned and towels changed very regularly. A fantastic location with MRT and supermarkets, restaurants etc just a short walk away.
Super comfy bed, great WiFi, lots of channels on the TV, quiet, I just love the place."
"I don't think there could have been anything done better. Both my wife and I truly appreciate the warm hospitality. The staff at Wilby are extremely friendly and delivered more than what was initially mentioned they would provide. In addition, the housekeeping staff, especially one lady in particular, were trustworthy, thorough and delightful to meet on a daily basis. Jasmine was the lady handling our stay and she never failed to respond quickly or make things easier for us - we're over the moon with the service all round.

If you're looking for a place that's centrally located for convenience, you've found your ideal home!"
Located in a lively neighborhood. Lots of bars and resrt. Also close to China town. The staff were polite and nice. Clean and safe room with a lovely touch.
The place is very nice better than expected. Me and my family enjoyed very much. Mr. Abi__ hospitality was exceptional. Will surely book again and will recommend this place to others too.
Ok
"The place is near the MRT station and hawker center which is super nice it help us save $$$. There__ also coffee and biscuits that you can drink and eat anytime.  And the host provided us things we needed, he__ super thoughtful. Will definitely book again. Thank you so much!"
"Cheap, homey, easy check in, 450m from MRT station,  near Mall location, close to bus stop."
Jojo has been accomodative to our last minute request . Glad that we get to book this place when other host ignore our queries & messages . The apartment is very well equipt and all essential stuffs are provided for our short stay. Thank you Jojo .
"Convenient Location
Great place to stay "
"Lovely place. Everything in walking distance. Host is quick response . Apartment is nice, clean, shine."
this is a serviced apartment that is good for 6-7 planning tot stay together for the trips. quite convenient to go to the attraction place.
"Since Jojo has a lot of listings here in Airbnb, I think it's fair to expect that what address you book could change. On our case, I think it went better since according to one of his staff, we got an ""upgrade""?

Plus for me is they were able to arrange for an early check-in. We arrived at the airport at 930AM and was able to check-in much earlier than 3PM.

Aircondition works well on the unit we got."
"I'm expecting a more hospitable and reliable host. At this time of pandemic bec of the virus happening all around the world I have tried to ask this host if we can reschedule the date bec. There is an option there. If there is additional payment maybe we can just pay it on hand or other terms,instead of cancelling but he said no."
"Clean and warm, got private parking and alot best restaurant"
"Very good apartments, its a new apartment"
"This room near MRT Paya Lebar and you can go to center palce so convenice. Host so nice. However, I look forward to more about quality on this trip."

"JoJo is a great host and was very prompt to reply, helpful and thoughtful! Location was fantastic as it__ easily accessible! Will definitely stay with JoJo again when we back in Singapore."
I will definitely recommend Jojo's place to friends and family. Thank you.

"Alex was a great host! Great location, good shower, quick answers."
"A great location. close to public transportation, restaurants, shopping."
"This place has one of the best location vs. price in S'pore. Walking distance to 3  MRT stations with access to most lines, and convenient bus stops, it's awesome. 
The place is new, no-old building here. Quiet  organized and clean. The security is great if you travel alone but wish little human contact. Great amenities, the pool is perfect to lounge in and read a book or just stare at the sky. 
Alex was beyond responsive, polite and fast during our exchanges."
"I stayed for 3 weeks at Alex's place and overall it was very pleasant. Is located in a nice building, with pool and gym, in a very pretty area. Fort Canning park is at a 2 minute walk and all Orchard commerce as well. The room has a comfortable bed, good AC, view to the city, and it's own bathroom which is great. Not easy to find places like this in Singapore at this price, and with such a wonderful host like Alex. Always friendly and helpful. 

I totally recommend it."
"Great place in a quiet center, modern furniture, fully equipped with everything one might need when traveling."
"This place is as pretty as on the pictures. It really is at 3 minutes from the MRT (and one of the main lines !). The owners are very kind, available and always helpful. They have good adresses for places to eat in the area. Don't forget your earplugs because of the noise down the street and your stay will be just perfect!"

"Jojo is a responsible host, will keep you update all the time especially during covid-19 time."
"Thank you, Ark, for the great service at your hostel at it was the best experience since it's our first time in Singapore and we appreciate your good hospitality. We recommend the hostel for a group of friends or family that needs a comfortable stay at a reasonable price. The location is accessible to the bus terminal and train stations which is very convenient. There are restaurants around the area. The breakfast we had is simple yet it made us full and bring the energy to start up our day before we enjoy our trips to different tourist spots. We'll surely book at your hostel on our next SG trip. Thank you :)"
Comfortable and clean room. Very thoughtful staff. In great location. I will stay here again
"Nice hotel, well situated and great value for money. Staff were excellent; very helpful!"
"The bed is a bit hard but you can ask for a mattress topper which makes the bed easier to sleep on. Be careful of your belongings in the room as cleaning staff either took our belongings (flip flops) or shifted them so we couldn't find them. Either way, They should not even be touching our belongings. Staff will not even post items they find that are left behind due to their error."
Decent stay
"Good and perfect location, friendly host with superb service !"

The host canceled this reservation 15 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
"great place to stay, location is close to the MRT with lots of hippy cafes around. Thank you David for the great hospitality too!"
"Small space, not too close to mrt maybe not so suitable for families with kids"

"My guests had great comments on the stay, checking in was easy and everything seems new. It's roomy enough for group of 10 and love that there's a 24H supermarket beside the apartment. The food nearby and durian are great, definitely coming back next time."
Good place to stay with your friends and family. The owner been great responsive for any enquires
Decent staycation with the girls. Loved the design concept of the place. Especially the playroom. Thank you Mr K.

"Reasonable, clean, convenient, suite for short stay. When i came for check in there was full so i have to move to stay in the room. And move out next day. Near mrt and also food around"
"Pretty much, what is written is true, super location for the subway/train. Love the white coffee I__e never experienced it before so it was a real special treat. That was available for breakfast and my only other comment which I forgot to do earlier as I think a brown or healthier bread would be better than the white. 
Also, All in all I would come back!!  
Evangeline"
Very accommodating host and very quick to respond to queries.
"Hillary is a great host, really fast response.

The place is really good for a budget long stay.
Wifi speed is good, location is good, a nice working desk.
And the toilet, kitchen and washing machine is good enough for this price.

The experience is much better than I stay in a budget hotel."

"We were traveling with children and because of the COVID-19 scare, we avoided the common areas except for the bathroom. There are a lot of inexpensive dining places around. It__ also a short walk from the MRT although on a hot day you__ prefer to take Grab."
Value for money
"Clean, central location, has 7/11 at the next building for quick snacks. Had a nice 5 nights with family.
Thanks David for the warm hospitality."
A great stay.
Awesome place for stay. Great value for money
"I needed a place to stay  for 6 people for an overnight stay before we embark for our Asian Cruise. Place is clean, very accessible to food and transit. Reasonably priced. Ideal for large families or single individuals who wants to stay for a day or two. There__ a flight of stairs though. But staff is very helpful and accommodating. Thanks David!"
The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
Was a good place
Great place
"I like to balcony, just like the Singapore shophouse ~ recommendable place but you have to bring your own teeth blush ~"
"The space was small so even though it says you can sleep three, I would not recommend it. The floors were not cleaned well, but the rest of the apartment was clean and in a good location."
"Place is very conveniently located near Somerset which is ideal as well as bus stop directly in front of the house, everything is great. Thank you for being accommodating to my last minute stay."
nice accomodation in a good neighbourhood. clean and well equipped. the room was a bit noisy from the traffic outside. we liked the place and can recommend it to others.
On the main road but balcony and location more than makes up for that
Great place
Amazing time....great location. Highly recommended
Nice place to spend a quiet day or 2 away
"This apartment vastly exceeded my expectations. The massive TV with Netflix was a bonus which I appreciated. There's also a balcony, washer/dryer, fridge, and comfy bed. Plus the wifi is fast. This is a great place, in an excellent location, right next to a bus stop which is only 2 stops away from Fort Canning MRT. And buses are coming all the time, so the most you would have to wait at the bus stop is typically 2-3 minutes. Close to a bunch of restaurants too. You better book the apartment if you've made it this far in the review."
"Really clean and lovely stay. Maybe suggestions lift was really slow even going to lvl 3. Please put kitchen towels /tissue paper and more toilet paper. Also the balcony should be more clean cauz it seemed not cleaned for some time. The bigger pot for cooking burnt easily maybe time to change. And the sink area not gd design as water splashes out easily (probably basin too small). Road side a little noisy but ear plugs would work fine. The Housekeeping knocked on my door at 1150am and asked what time I was checking out. I told him that my check out is at 1230pm not 12pm as agreed by host (even the check in guy mentioned 12pm but we did not mention anything as agreed by host) and he reacted blurly without saying a word before walking off. However, loved the design of the ceiling light and bathroom mirror light! Aircon was really gd and strong! Full set kitchen amenities and able to watch Netflix and YouTube (remote detector is abit slow for both)! Good shower pressure and toilet with bidet! Large wardrobe and deep able to fit approx 4 ppl inside lol! Very nice and fresh smelling bedding and towels! Overall value for money and will stay this room again soon! :)"
Check in was easy peasy. The apartment was very cosy and well placed. Sparkling clean too. Bathroom dries up very fast after use. Will definitely stay here again.
Great place
Ultimately we like the place. Walking distance to Orchard Centre
Awesome place to relax
"If you like staying in an apartment liken to an old conservation house with nice deco,  ideal for selfies.  This is a wonderful place."
Amazing
"Great private place, very cozy!"
Nice place .. Value for money . Please bring own toiletries (toothbrush & toothpaste).
"Clean and cosy apartment with big smart tv. Kitchen amenities are basic. Hard to sleep due to traffic noise. 
Recommended if heavy sleeper.
Easy check in."
Nice to stay n affordable price
Lovely place !
The place was really clean. Bed was comfy and it's walking distance to Somerset mrt. Would definitely come back again.
Nice and cosy. Location was great.
Excellent clean thoughtful place for a quick getaway.
great private place
"Thank you so much for the wonderful stay. I couldn__ wake up early; and asked for an extension of late checkout and host was gracious enough to extend it for me.

Also; quick and fast efficient communication. Thank you so much."
"Overall stay was pleasant, Kaurus is an highly understanding and very responsive host."
Kaurus is a very good host. The place is in a convenient location in the city with laundry and cooking facilities available. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Singapore 
-
David's place is in a great location. A hawker center and a lot of other local eats are nearby. Our room was also cleaned daily. Great option if you're looking for an affordable place that's accessible.
"owner was very friendly and accommodating but to be truthful, the place is not as good as the pictures. we thought that we got a whole place but we actually only got 1 room. understandable that some areas were closed due to covid-19 safe distancing measures but what we expected and what we got had such a vast difference. as for the day, we experienced multiple power outages which got quite frustrating at times as some were walking or pouring drinks that led to spillage because we couldn__ see. one of our friend__ bed had bedbugs which resulted in 7-8 huge itchy insect bites when he was sleeping. lastly, a random man went into our room as there was no lock. he went in and was very surprised that there were teens with a group of guys and girls, saying __ though that this room was only for girls?_ this caused the girls in the room to be scared to sleep as this happened at late 2am to 3am which left the impression that there was an invasion of privacy and our safety is neglected."
good place
Nice view along the river.
Clean and simple design space. Like the overall comfort feel of the space.
"Great location. This is nice studio with all the basic amenities, including your own washing machine. It is very conveniently located close to Clarke Quay. Communication with the host was smooth. I recommended this place."
"Good stay, great host. Clean and spacious room. Centralised location. 10min walk to Somerset."
"WORSE EXPERIENCE EVER. STAY AT OWN RISK ***

Guess what? The Aircon leak water WHOLE NIGHT n I have to hear the loud dripping water sound and the Aircon is absolutely broken down. No air at alland I texted her and no reply n I contacted Airbnb team n they asked me to wait for response and next early morning next door was renovating and fixing things knocking NOISY and I left early not sleeping and when I request politely for a refund this host says refund only $15 out of my $117 w/o any explanation and attitude was bad. I told her its her premises and property faulty is her responsibility and she say.....

The breakdown of Aircon is really unexpected and beyond our control.. what can we do to fix it. We understand Ur situation but sorry (bottom line is refund $15)

I told her that what she could at least fix is her attitude and her guest feeling after a whole night not sleeping due to what happened. Her attitude n reply is the worse she is not sorry for not servicing her Aircon and she doesn't care about guest comfort level and she DOES NOT have single bit of sorry and responsibilities instead she push it to the guest to shoulder all the ""unexpected"" in her property and she said sorry for inconvenience caused but she's not responsible for her broken space and............ 

Guess what she reply?...
""Thank you for your feedback.""

OMG TERRIBLE it's not bout the amount for refund but her attitude? She deserves nothing and her broken dusty space? NAH..  not value for money.

STRONGLY DONT RECOMMEND!"
Great place. But slow host reaponse.
Location is good and price is reasonable.
Nice Stay
Great location in walking distance of attractions and restaurants
Good location but the rooms could use a bit of renovation. Good for backpackers on a budget (though not that cheap) and for a few nights.
To pay attention more in the bathroom cleanliness. Handwashing soap would be a great help. The host is helpful indeed and she responds efficiently and quickly.
Very helpful and he helped me a lot by changing and providing necessary things at right time.
Very tiny space. Little dirty but ok
Nice host
"Great place, friendly and responsible host. Nice place for accommodation."
Good experience
"Check in was delayed as the cleaning was not finished on time. Wi-fi had issues and we couldn't connect it through out our stay. Shower head was broken and didn't flow well. Felt like it wasn't worth the value but we just make do.

Other than that we enjoyed our stay as the place is quite comfy with balcony area. A lot of food places nearby. Direct bus to town. Just ensure that all the issues above are fixed before letting others stay as it might cause inconvenience. I don't mind returning. Thanks for the fast response."
Highly recommended
"Location is very good in Holland V, about 5-minute drive to arrive at the shopping commercial area as well at the nearest MRT station, near Orchard Rd as well. The place is clean and comfortable."
Good
Nice spacious room that was clean and comfortable to stay in. Location of Lucy's apartment was great and very convenient. There were many food places nearby and Bugis Junction shopping mall was a short 2 minute walk away. Check in was smooth and Lucy responded to all my queries promptly. Thank you!
"Very close to the station, clean, quiet and comfortable!"
Great place in a fantastic location near everything you may need/visit in town. The room was just right for us two. Great massage chair in the hall!
"You'll definetly get all the benefits on Lucy's place, Location, Price , ameneties offered are all worth it! I'll book again when i come back so worht it !
Tips:
Just exit D at BUgis stn. look above to see Marrison Hotel and you are there next to the spa of The 101 Building_¤ï_ The location is near ar the Bugis Street Area where you can eat all you want :)"
"I highly recommend this place as the location is ideal and central to get to anywhere in Singapore.  The white theme of the place reflects the cleanliness of the place.  The room was sufficient enough to accommodate 2 people. 
The host Lucy is most hospitable and offered open communications from pre arrival to departure."
Lucinda was very attentive and nice. We enjoyed the area close to downtown and Bugis.
Lucinda is a very good host and the place was actually above our expectations
Lucinda was friendly and outgoing. Have a great stay at her place!
Great location
Host replied very quickly. She even moved us to a bigger room without any extra charges. If you__e okay with sharing some amenities with others then I highly recommend this place!
the room was really pretty and comfortable. lucinda gave speedy replies and was very helpful.
"Clean and well-equipped capsule bed. Bathrooms need more regular attention. Great location, good value."
"Un capsule hÃ´tel, confort correct mais un peu bruyant (bon j avais celui qui est le plus prÃ¨s des cuisines aussi. L Ã©quipe est trÃ¨s sympa sinon et pleins de petites attentions. Nous avons beaucoup d accessoires _ disposition (serviette,kit de brossage de dent.... Etc) tout le nÃ©cessaire."
"Convenient location, friendly owner. Perfect location  for food lovers."
"The best option for me and my daughter,  the location was very convenient- near to Bugis metro station. Supermarket, cafes and great restaurants were just around the corner. 
Walked on foot to Marina Bay Sands. (recommended) 
Great and friendly host, leave you at ease but responsive when needed."
Good location and convenient stay
"great hospitality and location, MRT is 10 minutes walk, we loved Bukit Timah nature reserve ,only 25minutes walk from the accommodation"
_ is a very nice host. She share their food with us as if we are their family. She helps us find nearby places to eat. The place is very beautiful. There is swimming pool and gym. The place is also near the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Our stay in _'s place is worth the money we spent.
"Super endroit, trÃ¨s abordable d'un point d evu financier. Bien situÃ©, propre, silencieux et des dortoires filles seules. Je recommande !"
The place is cozy and better than what we expected from a container hotel. Lorraine is a great host and thoughtful. Definitely will come back again.
Superb excellent place to stay in.
"As shown in pictures, very near to one north station"
"It was simply an amazing stay. Really nice place, clean, comfortable and well equippied. The host too was very sweet and welcoming. Highly recommended!"
Exceeded expectations. 100% recommended!
Lovely space and a very interesting concept. Would definitely stay here again
We were happy to note that the place was exactly what it looked like in the pictures. Location wise it was perfect for us as we were looking for a place not too near town but not too far away from civilisation either. Lorraine was very friendly and easy to communicate with. Having fusionopolis next door was also a plus as we could pop over to buy groceries etc. Would definitely recommend this place!
"Great place, very cosy and right opposite the mrt exit, very convenient, expected it to be small but the size was decent and comfortable! Very clean place as well"
"Lorraine is very helpful and responsive to our queries. Place of stay was unique and went beyond our expectation. There were lots of facilities nearby too. Basketball court, food court and even supermarket to ready ourselves in case we miss any ingredients for cooking."
Jing Is a resourceful  host that will provide with all of your needs as long as they are within her reach
"Jing is an excellent host. She responded quickly any questions and did all things possible to ensure we had a great stay.
Thank you Jing, Leon"
Jing is a great host always ready to help you with any problems!
We had a great time at_MBS for the weekend . The communication was super easy and quickwith Jing  and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. Would absolutely recommend to stay there!
Check in was smooth and Jing responded very quickly to any questions we had regarding the stay. Location and room was perfect overlooking Gardens By the Bay and with an outdoor balcony. Would book again in future!
Quick in responding. Clean and nice place to stay.
Great place. But it would be better if the check out would be at a later time
Clean
"Place was clean, location convenient, Benny replies very promptly."
Good place!
Very nice host and accommodations.cosy place!will return again 
big house. great for having staycay with friends and family.. will book again soon in the future
"Place is as advertised and very spacious. Albeit a bit far in, the place was otherwise easy to locate. Communication is very swift. 10/10 would recommend."
Great place to stay and the host was very understanding. Very easy accessible for shops and stuff.
A very strategic place with amenities within the vicinity.
Brandon is very accommodating and fast in responding to our queries. He provided us with clear instructions and tips about his neighbourhood and is always ready to help. Thanks for having us!
"Good location , easy food access"
"I recommend Brandon__ place for those who do not necessarily need to be central. There is everything around - 24h supermarkets, food courts, fast foods, shopping centres within walking distance. Public transports are easy to access as well, both buses and MRT. 
The room is big enough and well arranged with desk and hanging clothing rail. Also, the fan is appreciable.
Brandon is easy to contact and replies quickly. He is really helpful if you need any information."
Brandon is a hospitable and caring host. He is very helpful and promptly answers to queries that I have. A very pleasant stay with Brandon and his family :)
"Very good location in Little India, 5 min to MRT. Fast response and simple check in! Thanks a lot!"
"Ela was nice and gave clear and detailed instructions. However the bed sheets were quite dirty when we arrived and we had to find clean ones to replace them. We also had an ant problem in our room, our luggage was covered in them."
"I feel like the place wasn't as clean as I would have liked. There were dead cockroaches on the floor and some light mold. I don't believe I was provided clean bedding based off the smell of it. Homeless person and stray cats stayed outside the door. Very convenient to have the Mustafa center so close. Host was quick to respond and let me drop off my luggage before check-in time, which was very nice."
"It was an honour to be the first guest to Kfc and Derek's coliving venture. Coolly set up with nice little touches, in a clever Singaporean heritage shophouse conversion that is so in, it is perfect for my 2-week work stay. Great wifi, shower and Netflix TV went down a treat."
Thanks the host for a smooth and peaceful stay and most importantly for his prompt reply that has enable me to stay in for a last minute arrangment. For this I am greatly appreciative and thankful for his kind act. Room is super clean and I enjoyed my stay there. Sharing of electrical appliances was easy and it didn't take me long to familiarise how to operate them. Clear and thoughtful instructions were given by the host and I would definitely come back and book the room the next time when I needed it! Thumbs up for the host! 
The house is amazing. Easy and high-efficiency communication with host.
Good room!
"Amazing place! You will spend your time in a nice cozy room in a family apartment. Hosts are very hospitable, provided me with local tips and advices, directions, interesting places. The room itself is comfortable, with a wooden king bed - great sleep. Location is good - close to a bus stop from where you can catch a direct bus to Changi airport. Metro stations with connections to the city are also not far away. Great value, 5/5 rating :)"
Very smart in communication in different language and knowledge about the area of Singapore and surround area
"Very good host and great place to stay
Very convenient location and easy access to public transport and food."
"Great place to stay 
Very helpful host"
"Great and friendly host in a neat and clean house with a cozy room to stay in. Goes out of his way to check on welfare and to check if anything is required. Host is really friendly, understandable and went out of his way to help me during the covid pandemic. Fast and helpful responses. Convenient location with really great amenities nearby."
"worst experience,donot booking this host room."
"We had to change the location, but the new one was perfect: Beautiful, spacious apartment with a fantastic view! Good location, with bus stations near by. Kitchen and bathroom could be cleaner.. but we had a great stay, thanks."
Quiet environment
great apartment and about a 5-10 minute walk to the nearest metro. pretty spacious for a studio and comes with a balcony and washing machine. host is very responsive too.
Cool
"new, crisp, modern, private room with shared space, kitchen is well-equipped"
"This is my 2nd time staying here. Love the place here as usual. But I didn't realized that the room I booked for this is a shared bathroom! It's too troublesome to keep going out to the room to use toilet or even shower. Overall, the room is spacious and its cosy! Most importantly, it's clean (:"
Loved it! Value for money! Definitely will stay here again.

"It's a good place, however rooms aren't soundproof, despite already late at night"
Great place :)
"We love this hotel and its co-living concept! The bed is comfy and the bathroom is clean. We weren't able to use the pantry but it looks well-made. We are lucky to be one of the first guests in this new place! Just one comment: it'll be nice to have a hook to hang bathroom towels and toiletries. Other than that, everything is amazing! The location is the best I've stayed in during my visits in Singapore. :)"
"This place was too goo to be true. Super clean, great location, awesome staff, high-end amenities. I'd stay again in a heartbeat."
We really liked staying at ST signature! Nice place:)
One of the best place to stay for a quick getaway. Interior is very stylish and modern. Love the co living concept. Would definitely go back soon
We enjoyed this fancier version of a hostel. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen is fully stocked and the staff are very friendly! The location of this co-living hotel is great and convenient. We would stay here again :)
"We had a great experience with ST signature hotel. It__ a morden, stylish and clean place with good connection with metro just around the corner. The place is in a great location. The ST has a very nice and clean kitchen with coffee machine and it seems convenient for long stay, too. Definitely highly recommended!"

"Hi guys. This place is lovely and beautiful.  The kitchen is very well equipped.  
The location is excellent. Just across from the MRT station.
Plenty of restaurants close by.

Just sharing our experiences with regards to the rooms. It was difficult for us to get an accurate picture of the rooms from the pics. 
The rooms on the ground floor 
Are very uniquely designed , they are at split levels. No windows and the toilets are outsidedown the corridor. 

But once we got used to this we loved the adventures stay.

The host is good. Understanding. They responded quickly.

We later moved to a different room on the 2nd floor with a Window and a attached bathroom. This was a little more convenient. 

Overall a wonderful place to stay. 

The online self checking can be a bit challenging for those who arenot very savvy technologically.  

It would have been great if there was a manager on duty round the clock at the venue."
"The place is so nice, in 1 min from the nearest station.
Even though restrooms and showers were shared, all of them were clean."
"Tempat yang strategis di depan pintu keluar B MRT Jalan Besar. Satu jalur platform dan tidak pindah lagi bila kita menggunakan  MRT dari Sky Train Changi. 

Tempatnya bersih, modern minimalis.  Dengan fasilitas dapur dan ruang duduk yang nyaman. 

Berbagi toilet dan kamar mandi, sering jadi pertimbangan. Tetapi lebih dari yang saya harapkan, kamar mandinya bersih dan modern. 

Untuk yang mencari makanan halal, dekat sini juga ada. 
Saya mencari seven eleven yang dekat dan menemukan toko kecil yang lengkap dengan harga yang lebih murah.

Saya mencari hotel budget dalam kunjungan yang singkat.
Dan saya mendapatkan fasilitas hotel dan kenyamanan  rumah. Sesuai harganya, bila kamarnya memang kecil. 
Dan bila anda membawa anak kecil pastikan anda memilih kamar dimana tempat tidurnya tidak diatas, karena ketinggian yang bisa berbahaya."
"I really can recommend this place. it was clean, comfy and the rooms are stylish."
the room is lovely!
Great place to commute
The ST Signatur (Jalan Besar) hostel is a great choice for everyone. Especially the close location to the metro station is perfect to get fast and easy around town. The concept of the hostel is pretty cool and everything is freshly renovated. Also the staff is very helpful and friendly. We would totally recommend it to everyone.

Loved this place great value! Sparkling clean and newly refurbished and everything was high tech. Smart TV for netflix was great. Loved the free coffee and nice large area for cooking and chilling! Nice showers and good location. Would definitely recommend!
The room was clean and beautiful! A stone throw away from jalan besar mrt station!
"Clean, great location, facilities and the bed is amazing good night sleep."
"Very nice place to stay. It__ very good for value and the host is very nice. 
We asked to move to another room because our previous room was a bit noisy (because its next to the showering room and the door shut loudly) and the host responded us very quickly! They even fix the door right away. 

The room is small but very cozy and clean. They have good quality facilities too. 

Altough they do a self-check in process, but their staff is always there to help. They are also very nice and polite.

The hotel is just opposite of mrt station and you can find many restaurant around the neighbourhood. Very recommended place to stay."
Great place! Near metro station. Super clean and nice bathrooms.
Very comfortable and modern place. Totally worth it!
"In any outbreak situation, Airbnb is not ready. Owner is responsive, however owner's agent is not responsive, not providing a reason for cancel my refund"

Great hotel to be in with a good value !!
Nice
"The place is a great place to stay. I would highly recommend the place to all my friends. But because of the circuit breaker, the facilities isn't fully utilised.

The policy of your room ""got window, no tv"" ""no windows, got tv"", i am not a big fan of this policy. It is absolutely annoying to have no TV in the room. That mean customer has to bring laptop. Mini Fridge and hair dryer for example should be given to all room. 

After all, it has been a great stay. I would recommend to my families and friends."

"Love the room, stylish room and great pricing! Will book it again if I can!"
"Super friendly host, superb facilities, highly recommend!"
The place is really great and relaxing :) it__ clean and the soap and shampoo smells so good. the hosts are really patient in answering all my questions. I enjoyed my stay
Very clean space with comfortable beds and nice showers. Staff was friendly and helpful. Check-in and lock system is easy to use. Stayed in a private room with a loft bed which was perfect for one person. Would highly recommend over a hostel.
The location is good and near the heart of Singapore.
"å¾_¹¾æ·¨ä_å¾__ä¾,_ºä_å°±æ_Mrtç«,_¨æ_______ç®__ä¾¿å__!"
"The host accused us smoking in the room. Asking for compensation. When I request for evidence and more explanation. No response from owner anymore.

Housekeeper might still go inside your room even after you said no house keeping needed.

The host said the cigarette smell is so strong that he has to close down the place. Let's see"
Clean and stylish space with great amenities!! Will definitely come back again

"Nice, modern and clean stay. Great connection with MRT into the whole city.
Would stay again at this place"
A great place and value for a short stay or getaway. Would come here again
"Nice room. Great location. Easy to access by mrt. Hope the host can be at the outlet at all times permanently so that when any guest who need help they will be there to assist, as the iPad in the lobby can't solve all the problems (E.g changing of rooms etc) Do take this suggestions seriously. Thank you."
"The stay was very cozy and comfortable, it was my first experience staying in such a cozy room and the wash and bathing space outside the room. I had to be in my bathrobe to wander around , I loved the cook lab, it was really beautiful and well equipped. Loved cooking our breakfast there. Overall the entire space is spic and span. I feel the washing and drying machines (laundry) for the guests should have been complimentary. 
I will definitely recommend this place.
Thank you Alex, you were very helpful."
Amazing place and wonderful people! Thank so much! Hope to return again in the future:)
"Good place, would recommend to visit for a stay"
It is really a nice place to stay and is near to city areas. Strongly recommend anyone who is looking for a short getaway to stay there. Also only cons is that climbing the ladder up to the bed is abit painful so it will be much better is host can add some cushion into it
Such a cute place! We loved the loft bed! Check in was a breeze! Location is perfect in little India. They have a kitchen to cook in but most importantly an amazing coffee station!!
"This is the best location you can ever get in singapore. I mean, it__ only a few footsteps to downtown mrt line :)"
Love the place! Super duper clean and modern looking. You can even watch Netflix till you snooze. Perfect for those who want a break from the city.
"Easy to locate, check in was smooth and room was clean and very cozy"
It__ a great staycation for one person I must say. Nice loft.
Alex place is definitely a gem . Is not only near city area but he has all the essential stuff that is needed for an hotel given his rates I highly recommend everyone to stay his place. Only downside I feel is that there is no TOP window.
A great stylish place to stay at!
good
"Everyone who is looking for nice place to crash near the CBD area , Alex place is definitely a go-to hotel. Is nice and is private."
great stay comfy place
The Host wasnt reponsive. Horrible place
"Loved the room and hotel design, great value for money!"
You can expect a pleasant stay which exceeded many expectations! Accommodation was really clean & our hosts were very accommodating. It made my stay hassle free & all necessities can be found within the premises & hotel itself. I am so satisfied!
Awesome place
"First time staying at alex's place. 
I like how easy the process of check in was.  However, i would prefer the other outlets much more due to better and lower noise levels. Other than that, the stay was good. The good thing about alex's place is that the loft had sturdy steps. And thumbs up for cleanliness"
God
An amazing and cozy place with superb cleanliness.

Super neat
"Stylish design , Super clean"
Nice place to stay
"You guys should try it yourself, for my point of view, alex place is the best stay i had so far, and i like how does the self check in works, its really cool though. So ya, this is only come from my perspective. Ive enjoy my stay at alex place, 5 star for you bro. "
Surprisingly really clean and the location is great (very convenient!!)
Way better than expected. Really cool concept of a room. Will definitely return!
"Hassle free ,great location and comfortable! Would definitely come again!!!"
Naise
Room is as photos and I would recommend it. Definitely would return 
Nice place
"Booked the upper deck bed, feels cosy ,the furniture and shower is of good quality not like some cheap hotels. Rooms comes with mini fridge."
A nice place to relax and recharge and the concept of co living is quite cool
great stay
"Worst experience ever!!! Was accused by host for smoking in the room and was asked to pay a fine of $500 for smoking in the room without any evidences. When we told the host that we are not gonna pay the fine as they don__ have any evidences, the host threatened us to call the authorities. When the authorities came, they told us they couldn__ do anything as they don__ have any evidences. Thanks to the authorities for being fair and their professionalism. And host asked me & bf to leave the hotel and done a refund for us. I will bring up this matter to CASE, as I__ still not happy for being accused for things that me & bf didn__ do. Thanks!"
Good
Great
Superb
Cool place to stay.
Place was awesome and comfy.  would recommend to anyone out there
"great place! location super good, infront of jalan besar mrt :-) and instruction given for check in was also sufficient!!"
its clean & cosy & cold. the aircon is great. a lil small. _ºï_
Smooth sailing self check-in! That__ one really cool feature of the hotel. The location is great - it__ right opp the mrt. Hope to come back again in the near future!
It__ a nice place! Recommend for those travelling alone or in pair. I loved my stay as the place cleanliness was tip top!
A peaceful place to stay in

Good!
Good stay
"It was OK. The room was really cosy but here comes the flaws;

1. The lowest temperature the aircon could go was 23Â°C. Maybe there was a way to go lower but we didn't figure out how. As the aircon is facing the living area instead, it wasn't as cool as I wanted it to be.

2. Lack of toiletries. We had get our own as we don't want to have a stinky mouth the next day.

3. The bedsheets were dirty and when I contacted the host through the app, no one responded.

The good thing is it was really cosy  and there were good food near the place."
Both host and also the staffs at st signature were very prompt. They were very welcoming and friendly. Our stay was very pleasant. Me and my husband really loved it despite the fact that the space were a little small and AC temperature were locked at the standard temp. But it was wonderful!
Excellent place highly recommended
"THE GOOD:
Great location, a short distance to eateries and nearby malls by walking or taking the bus/train. Stylish interior and well thought-out amenities like the co-working spaces and a communal kitchen with top-of-the-line appliances. The bedding was really comfortable, definitely had a good rest. Everything can be conveniently communicated to the host via the app.

THE BAD: 
Make sure to CHECK-IN PROPERLY on the app because the room will still be marked vacant if you don't do so, and the staff can enter the room at anytime which happened in my case. During the stay, about every now and then, there were people trying to open the door handle or touching the keypad which was a bit alarming but it might've just been sound traveling from the neighbours entering their room."
Will be back
A nice place
It was clean and the hospitality was great
NIL
great location and nice loft concept! a little smaller than pictures show but cosy!
the place is great
Good place for short stays. Nearby food places and very convenient.
Cozy vibes
Lovely place
Comfy place and also sparkling clean
Great but a bit small
"Place is cozy, true to pictures. Check-in process is very seamless and staff were helpful in helping us with what we need. Highly recommended."
This place was super cool and relax.. easy to get shop and very near to shopping mall too...
"Very simple and minimalistic. Great place for a nice peaceful stay. Place is just right outside of mrt, very convenient."
Would come back again :-)
"This place is everything I look for in an airbnb - affordable, stylish, and spotlessly clean, and I very much appreciated how easy it was to check in and out. This would be a great place to stay for backpackers looking to socialise as there are many communal areas here. The hosts were also very hospitable. Thank you for providing us with a nice stay!"
The room was great and host was very friendly. 10/10 would come back
Comfortable place and convenient location!
Great place!
Nice n clean
"great place second time here, worth it"
"Sauber und fÃ¼r den Preis zu empfehlen. Keine MÃ¼cken , Spinnen oder sonstige Tiere im Zimmer. Ist ein sehr kleines Zimmer aber fÃ¼r ein paar Tage sollte dies kein Problem sein. Gastgeber bzw. Hosts antworten sehr schnell. Ist alles neu und unverbraucht da anscheinend vor kurzem erst die ErÃ¶ffnung war."
"Everything was perfectly clean! Everything is there what you need. Even Netflix in bed. Location was good. Just next to the metro station, easy to connect anywhere in the city! Loved Kampong glam. Just a few minutes walk from your place! Definitely highly recommended!"
Great stay! Cosy room. Great host. Good location. Easy to access to mrt. Lots of nice food nearby. Reasonable price. Will definitely stay here again.
"It was simple and stylish room. I love here__ bed :) for check-in, staff guy was very kind and supportive. Common space also good. There was nice kitchen area and it seems convenient for long stay, too."
Really nice. A modern and warm place!
A very nice place to stay in and very clean! 10/10 would recommend
nice stay!
"Small yet spacious. How can a tv, fridge, closet, queen bed and wide bathroom be so comfortable and such a tight space! Amazed! Definitely coming again!"
Clean and stylish space! Really enjoyed my stay. There was Netflix tv and a fridge.
"L'hÃ´tel est trÃ¨s propre, la cuisine trÃ¨s bien Ã©quipÃ©e, c'est parfait si vous voulez cuisiner, le wifi est trÃ¨s rapide et la position est vraiment trÃ¨s bien (_ cÃ´tÃ© vous avez plains de bar et restos). Je conseille fortement !"
So clean and so happy with this place!!
"Place was cozy and clean, would definitely come back again!"
"We really love our stay. The check-in/out is no hassle. Everything you need is there and more. They have a kitchen where you can prepare ur meal, a water dispenser and a ref. It's conviniently located near (just across) the mrt and bus station. 15 mins walk away from Bugis street market, |hadji lane and Mustafa center. 

Bed is so comfy w/ 2 pillows that we sometimes just want to sleep than to roam around. :)

Will definetly gonna book this place again if we're visiting Singapore again. "
"The place is nice, near to all malls etc"
"Super clean, comfortable and at a good location!"
"Place is clean and very comfortable. Many amenities available and location is great aswell.  Great place to chill and relax from the hustle of the city life

Really hope this place maintains its standards and quality throughout the years to come

Definitely a place to recommend to family and friends"
Cosy room with comfortable and clean common areas
"one of the best airbnb's  I have been to. My queries were answered perfectly , the host really helped accommodate all my requests! super clean ! easy access and great location! (: will definitely book again!"
"Superb cleanliness, great value for money will return in the future"
I would recommend ST signature for a comfy stay.
"Byli jsme zde 2 noci a vÅ¡e bylo v po_Ã¡dku. UbytovÃ¡nÃ­ se nachÃ¡zÃ­ v dobrÃ© lokalit_, hned u stanice metra Jalan Besar. Check-in je snadnÃ½.

Great facility in a great location. Very close to MRT
Very seamless checkin experience!
I will come back.
Modern value for money space.
The 24h/7 slamming doors hotel welcome!
Great place for a short stay. Great location. Super clean and stylish
Nice place to stay.
"The price is reasonable, if you want to save cost, this can be one of the selection. 
but the room space is very small."

"What a wonderful and comfortable place to stay for a day!! Location was great and indeed, it looks just like a hotel!! Would definitely come back again! :)"
Clean and easy check in!
The place is beautiful and the amenities of the hotel are great for a nice getaway. Be prepared for a troublesome self-check in process and weird stares from people in the lobby when leaving your hotel though. This place is definitely worth the price and I highly recommend it to couples or individuals who need to isolate themselves from the world.
A great place to stay as its very cozy and most importantly clean !
"Perfect location, right beside mrt station. Tidy room, although quite small but worthy enough for such price."
A very vibrating accomodation which is superb for short stay. The concept of cook lab is very good that it provide all cooking amenities and utensils including an oven for the convenience of all. Overall the room is clean and the staff is ready to help.
Fantastic place to stay. Be it a nite or many nites! A choice well made!
Neat place. As shown in the pictures and they really do get back to you. They even found my partner's hand towel that we accidentally left behind. Great place for a short getaway 
"Great location that's super central and near the train station. Situated in the heart of little india, you won't be disappointed with lots of food options around. Host was responsive to my queries and concerns before and during the stay. I like how they use digital app for check in, check out and things needed, no need for keycards or phones as every housing need can be operated via the app (or ipad they provide downstairs).

The room was super clean and well designed with a desk and toilet that came with it. Despite being small, it didn't feel like there was a lack of space. It was cosy and nice to rest in. There are options for those who don't mind the shared bathrooms (these are cheaper options) which are amazingly clean as well. 

They have great staff like Fang/Alex (who replies queries before booking), Arina (who's excellent at showing us around, welcoming us and checking on us and what we needed with care) and a wonderful and hardworking Mona who keeps the place super clean. I also enjoyed the pantry area which was a fully functioning kitchen with utensils, cook ware and fridge that makes the place feel more like a well thought out communal home. 

For those who want a desk to work out off, the Jalan Besar branch has ample work spaces with powerplugs and aircon (right outside your rooms on the upper levels) and a meeting room to use if needed.

Overall, a pleasant and highly recommended place to all who are keen on a central, well-priced and well-designed and serviced place."
"Awesome place
Easy check in"
Will definately book again for my own time soonest.
Good place. Nice environment.
Good
"Very affordable stay, relatively near town. Walkable distance from MRT. Smooth high tech check-in and out with prompt responses and confirmation from the team. Generally clean space and toilet but found a few stains. Otherwise, lovely stay! "
Clean and great stay (:
__ë¡ ______ __ _¸í__. ê¹_____
Very clean and easy self check in. Took less than 10 minutes to check in. Staff was very helpful as we were not sure how to operate the door. She even came up to the room and teach on how to use it. Will come back.
"Great stay, was so tidy and clean it made the whole experience a much better one highly recommended for its price wise also!!"
Easy to check in! Room is privacy and clean
"Very clean,cozy place to stay"
Nice place for a night of recharging
"It got everything a basic hotel room should minus the window. ( there is no window)
A big tv with only netflix option.
Mini fridge that's workable and cold as compared to other hotels.
Hairdryer included.
Nice comfy queen bed with 4 pillows comforter. ( some hotels dont  all that! ) 
Clean nice shower/bathroom minus the bidet or water hose attached beside toilet bowl. Shampoo and body wash included. Exclude toothbrush and paste.
A seamless check in! Just need to know wat room ur assigned and key the code on the room door and ur in! Skip the hassle of registering at the Reception as there isnt any! Which is good! 
A really small room but it's good for a nite stay away from Home.. 
There u go a detail description of the hotel room and the stay. Thumbs up!"
Valued for money

Great experience! Small room but clean and pretty comfortable bed :)
Clean place .
"Overall the hotel stay was very clean and had a very modern look. The hotel looks completely brand new with the kitchen area having a lot of complementary items to use. The staff for housekeeping and the hosts for each shift was welcoming and helpful. There were more negative aspects of my hotel stay than I expected. There were at least 5 unexpected fire alarms that took too much time to cancel. They had to call in a host from another location of ST Signature to figure out how to cancel the annoying fire alarm since every staff was not properly trained. More of these fire alarms were late at night while we were sleeping. The hotel did not do the best job of supplying certain things on time. I had to ask numerous times for more toilet paper and shower gel. There were times when I clearly had zero toilet paper, housekeeping would come in to clean and replenish my room and would not supply me more toilet paper or shower gel. The WIFI was great most of the time we were there. We stayed for about 3 months and about 20% of the time the WIFI was not working and took a while to finally work. That can be annoying when you are new to a country with nothing to do and you rely on the internet for entertainment."
"Place was splendid and clean..
Above expectation...
Overall excellent"
Clean and nice place to be
Lovely and comfortable place
Amazing location to get started in Singapore. Easy to reach MRT and great food choices around studio.

Great and good friendly staff.

Great experience
"Convenient to the downtown line station Jalan Besar, less than 5 mins walk from the station. Food stalls are around the corner and just a walking distance. You can walk to Bugis for 10-15 mins from the hotel. Great amenities: kitchen, living room lounge, working space. Space are clean. Room is cozy and comfortable for 2 people. Exactly the same as shown in the photos."
"Abit smaller than expected, but place was clean and stylish. Toilet was quite big for room size."
It's worth the price
Good service
"The place was sparkly clean looking almost brand new. Everything was in place and working (toilet, tv etc). The photos were accurate but room is slightly expensive for size. Nonetheless, the bed and pillows were super comfy!"

"Great place to stay. Although place is small but toiletries and cleanliness of the towel, bedsheet, place itself are comparable to good hotel standards."
"Room was kind of small but acceptable. Staff was not so friendly. Room is totally not sound proof at all. I could hear people walking outside all the time and people from the next door knocking on the partition wall. But location wise, it__ good and convenient."
"To whoever wanna have short stayca, would recommend this! Affordable, and okay.."
Worth the money
Great

"What I love about the place is CHEAP!  A 2 mins walk to the nearest MRT station, and you know it, its Geylang, so night life is a huge hit in the area. The appartment and common area is nice and decorated, very good spot for dropping by for a rest and continue travaling. Overall, great place and safe to overnight. "

"Great host, great place and truly a value for your penny."

A very nice and pleasant place to stay.
"The Cradels condo 1BR is convenient for food as well as transportation. There are 24/7 7eleven, food market and food stall nearby the condo. There is also a bus stop just outside if u want to travel to other venue. The apartment is clean, spacious and come with a balcony. Tanny(the host) is very nice and response fast to all my enquires. I have been looking for an apartment for a staycation and if can bring my pet along will be good. I try my luck to ask the host and the host is very kind enough to allow me to bring my pets with me. Thank you. I enjoy my stay there and will come back again "
Everything was good
Nice
"Didn't get to stay due to air con issues. Nonetheless, wanna thank the host for letting me know in advance and going through the hassle of cancellation"
"I am referring to the Loft unit that I stayed in Gate City. It has a best location for best local foods, all well known restaurants was located along Beach Road, not to forgot the local Hawker centre for inexpensive foods about 200 meters away.

Jay's team have been very helpful with fast response during my whole 34 days stay, not to mention during the difficult time of lock down period due to Covin-19.

Higher recommended to stay."

"Darren__ place is very convenient for travelers with waking distance to MRT blue and purple/red line. 24 hours food court, McDonald__ etc. down the street. most importantly, Darren is a real cool guy."
"Me and my friend had a really good time and a good experience. The place is well located, close to the center ! The bedroom was really cool with a lot of place to put your clothes and stuff. Darren was a friendly host and he was answering text quickly. I will definitely recommend this place ! "
"Had a very pleasant stay - the location is spot-on, great host, and the place is very clean. It's the best Airbnb place that I've stayed in during my time in Singapore. I will definitely come back in the future!"
"Best AirBnB in Singapore - I stayed here twice and I will come back again in the future. Amazing location, clean room/bathroom, and the host is very easy to talk to. I recommend this place to anyone traveling to Singapore!"
We had a very good stay at Darren__ place. The room was clean and had everything we needed.
Fantastic host with a fantastic room!
Great place
Nice and easy going host.

Excellent place and friendly host!
Paul was very prompt in his replies and provided relevant info on the stay. The apartment itself was cozy and clean and situated in a quiet area. Nice balcony to just sit and chill. Overall enjoyable experience from a great host
"Good host, great place. Well prepare amenities provided by the host. Definitely will book from him again"
"There are positives and negatives to this place. To start with the good:
- the host was lovely and very contactable, helping us with the minor teething issues of the apartment.
- the location is great. Two blocks from Orchard road. Close to MRT. 
- the apartment is very clean. A definite credit to the host.
- wifi is great.

The cons:
- We didn't get a lot of sleep here. There is a communal toilet and shower connected by the same wall as the apartment, right outside the door. This means whenever someone showers or goes to the toilet, you hear absolutely everything. It's quite gross. There is a fair bit of traffic in this communal bathroom, surprisingly between 12-2am at night. There is also a resident that wakes at 4.30 each day and uses it, so you get to wake up then too. When the light goes on, this also shines through the cracks in the door too. 

Also, there is a large down pipe that runs through the room (at the base of the bed). So everytime someone in the apartment upstairs flushes their toilet or runs the water, it's like a large water feature flushing through the room.

Also, the bed is very very hard. 

I wish we had of known about the noise, as we wouldn't have booked the place knowing this. We really had bad, interrupted sleep here and our kids were woken up frequently. 

The hosts were very lovely about it however there is nothing they can do. Perhaps more upfront information about the noise/communal bathroom adjoined to the apartment in the advertisement would have been appreciated."

Great space and clean. Loved the little plants placed inside the space. Wifi is well connected through the space.
Convenient location to shops
"Great location, with many convenience! Spacious for a one bed room and quiet area."
Place is very clean and host is very very accommodating to make things easier for me due to my work schedule. Host is also very helpful with fast replies and ensure that things go smoothly throughout the whole transaction without giving you a sweat.
"Cosy, clean and nice place. Recommended."
Host was accomdating and helpful.
"A clean and quiet place, very nice location as well"
Good stay!

"Good location. But not much as else. The house has heavy smoke stench. If you are a non-smoker make sure you are ok with that. 

Checking in was not straightforward and requires (Hidden by Airbnb) coordination with at least two different people. Even though the check in says 3 PM, I got access only around 3:40 PM as they were doing last minute cleaning. 

During my stay the air conditioners in the living room started leaking water. The host asked me if I can coordinate the timings with the service technician which I refused."
Awesome host! Will book again! Highly recommend
I had an excellent stay
Good for cost
"There are like these picture!
And Chelsey help me a lot and the communication was very smoothly!
But If you are girl, I don't recommend to stay for long time, because some residents are men.
But totally Chelsey was nice!"
convenient location and nice cute place to stay in.
"Lovely apartment with a great view of the city - a mix of terracotta roofs in Chinatown and luxurious skyscrapers. The pool is great, the gym is small but useful and the sauna is amazing!!!!!!! The bathroom door is a little weird (pretty but not very private) but there is another door that separates the bathroom/bedroom from the living space if you are hosting company and if you are by yourself it is fine. The best part of this airbnb is the location- walking distance to countless restaurants and fun bars as well as two MRT stations. I would love to stay in this location again."
"Great location, easy check in and communication!"
"Roy was a great host and both his dad (Jason) and Roy were very helpful. The place is brand new and they are wrapping up the last work on the house. Overall we really enjoyed our stay with Roy. Some things to note, there is no kitchen. The available ""kitchen amenities"" are a cooker plate and a pot (no cutlery, etc.). Also, there is no laptop-friendly workspace as listed in the amenities. One downside for us was that the room is connected to a publicly available balcony that is accessible by all tenants and where people come to smoke, etc. Since we were working from home it felt a bit awkward when people were looking in our bedroom while they were smoking, hanging clothes to dry, etc. Also, the neighboring house is currently a construction site. They are rebuilding the whole house with heavy machinery so it can be noisy from 9 am - 8 pm Mo-Sa. As we were working from home it was a bit annoying, but nothing that Roy or Jason could fix.

Overall it's a really nice place and I recommended it to everyone who wants to discover Singapore. It's close to little India and public transportation takes approx. 30 minutes to downtown."
Great place to stay. Definitely worth it! Book yours now why are you reading the review? HAHA the photo look exactly how the place is! Definitely will go back there soon!
The place was arranged within an unexceptionally tight timeframe and the host responded and arranged quickly.
Convenient location with lots of eatery around and a shopping mall. Just min away from bus interchange and train station.  The apartment suits for small family stay.
Clean and room is as shown as in pictures. great facilities
Great place for a relaxing stay .host is friendly and helpful .
No blankets
"Awesome place to stay. Host is v kind n friendly, everything is awesome. So far the best airbnb I've stay. Went to many airbnb yet this the best"
Very convenient & easy accessibility
"listing was accurate, host was responsive to help with heater problem. but overall, it was a bad experience because at about 5pm, the host called and said they gave us the wrong apartment and requested us to check out of that unit immediately. i asked to stay because we are getting ready to cook dinner but the host said its best to check out for our own good. we checked out the first place in a hurry and when we were leaving, the aircon technicians went in for servicing. the new unit is a few units away but when we were there,  it wasnt clean up and ready for check in. it was supposed to be a relaxing weekend but with all these changing of unit and waiting for it to be clean up with no place to go, it was too much of a hassle so we left. 

it was bad experience with host because it was the host that gave us the wrong keys for check in and yet he questioned us why are we in the wrong apartment... the mood of the relaxing stay was gone when he asked us to check out when we were about to start cooking, yet the new room is not ready for check in."
Simple unit with basic amenities provided in a good location for food
Fast check in and good communication with David. The place is too tight and small. Not recommended for more than 3 ppl to stay. Lovely for couples
"Absolutely ridiculous host. Book this listing if you want to waste your time. 

Didn__ even have the decency and responsibility to inform me prior about reparation works in the apartment until I called him when I was already at the apartment lobby. He sounded so shocked when he picked up the phone like he didn__ even know there was a guest checking in that day. In the end he cancelled on me and wasted my time and money because I got charged fees for literally nothing. Had to change my plans at the very last minute. Irresponsible."
"We stayed in Room D, with private bathroom. The location is at a quiet, exclusive area. The entire house is brand new, so there are little things to be added here and there. Roy was very responsive the entire time, and provided what we needed very quickly. Thank you!"
Nice place and Nice people.
Clean and stylish place! Will be back :)
Friendly and good place to staycation
"Highly recommended Roy__ place. Very spacious place with big glass door straight to balcony. Convenient location in quiet neighbourhood. There is no kitchen but you can use the fridge outside hallway to stored your food or drink, also, even tho the balcony is linked between rooms, but don__ worry, nobody will disturb your privacy."
Very accommodating and fast response. Room is clean and spacious.
Classy clean and comfortable.
It's a great place to stay and 100% privacy. It's easy to travel around with two mrts nearby and a lot of local food courts.
suoer friendly and warm household :)

Great place
Accommodating <3
The host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
"This is one of the best places I have check-in. The room was super cozy with wifi, starhub tv channel, super clean ambience and it is high floor overseeing the nostalgic tan tock seng hospital and its colonial houses along Moulmein Road and its vicinity. Easily accessible to the location. I would consider very much to return to the said place again. The host is friendly and attend to your needs expeditiously. Mark my words this place is worth to stay. I love this place so much. Great place to spend your quiet weekends n enjoy the scenery."
"Awsome place, the host was friendly"
Wonderful place.
"Did not get to stay with Jing due to the Covid-19 situation but Jing was very understanding by allowing us to postpone the staycation to a later date.
Can__ wait! This is my second reservation with Jing. My family and I enjoyed it the previous time, sure to be great this time round too!"

Clean and comfortable
"Excellent hospitality, great location, very clean, modern new building, stylist, and quiet.

Thank you"
The place is clean and the location is excellent. Christine is a thoughtful and friendly host taking care of your every need. Great recommendation for your wonderful holidays experience.
"If you want a quiet short getaway, this is a very relaxing place to be."
Nice cosy place. If you drive and ride no worries for car park in the city. Swimmming pools and amenities are excellent. Overall very nice place to stay at. Recommended for home owner who are renovating or traveller with short or long term.
Great place and quiet! Great for small family! Amazing 6 pools and other amenities!
"A great room to recommend to anyone who wants to have a short stay! Although the room is mall, it is really comfortable and it feels like home."

Host responds fast and made our stay a very pleasant one. She was accommodating and understanding!

Love that checkin and checkout were so fuss-free!
Recommended. Cozy place to stay.
Great stay! Highly recommended to all. Great location and greatly priced.

10/10 and highest recommendations, we will definitely be back!"
"It has super great location. Room is clean and nice, only remember it is quite small so dont bring too much luggage ;) Generally it is a great value with good price."
"Great location, clean room, shampoo and soap smells good, bed was super comfy, host is very accommodating and even let us check in early and check out late subjected to availability. The only downside is the housekeeping that came knocking 4 times before 12pm even though we already replied, and even opened the door but thankfully we hooked it. And no hot water after 15 minutes of showering perhaps due to sharing with other guests. Will visit again"
"Nice place to stay in, unique self-check-in mechanics."
"It was great actually would recommend 10/10 to stay in the ST signature series. It was worth the money! Even though it is not a typical hotel that is a big building, but if I were to give it a star rating! I would definitely give it a 5 which is very high in terms of SG standard. Easily accessible to city as it__ very near my office if I need to go back too"
This is my second time I stayed here. Always perfect point to sleep without any noises. Self check-in and check out procedure is unique.
Good place. Nearby to mrt.
Convenient place
"Place was located close to bugis mrt. theres nearby 7/11 for you to get any snacks when you__e bored and just want something to munch on while you watch your netflix in your room  Clean, neat, amazing place to stay in! Tho its a little small, its still comfortable! you can easily reach out to them thru the tablet (Hidden by Airbnb) they place at the lift!"

"Good location. Room is clean.

"Second time here,easy self check in,sparkling clean"
The place is really quite smaller than expected . But it__ perfect if all you want is a place to sleep . There__ close to zero walking space in the room except for right in front of the door . There__ no toothbrush or cups. Which is all pretty expected so it was still fine with me . What I really like was their customer service was really good . Polite and prompt communication . Definitely would come back .
Everything is good and clean just only there is no toothbrush and toothpaste in room
Everything is good for short trip

Generally clean and decent.
"Place looks just as advertised. Although small, it__ clean and well organised. For those sensitive to sound - The air-conditioning unit (at least the one in our room) is rather noisy and we could hear surrounding noises (I.e. the opening and closing of elevator doors, other guests checking into their rooms, footsteps and verbal conversations in the night due to poor sound-proofing."

Value for money
A very nice place for a getaway for just a night from the stress of work 
Nice and cozy
Walls were dirty and stained. Non-stop construction noise right in front of hotel at 1130pm on a Saturday night. Had to check out at 1230am as the noise was unbearable. Room was more spacious than anticipated but definitely will not be coming again and will not recommend to others.
Nice place for staycay!

i really love the place
They are fantastic!
really easy to check in and it is really near bugis mrt station. would definitely come back
"Nice place,
The rooms are very clean as the place is brand new.
Location is really good. Very central. Good food places around and close to the MRT.
One side of the building faces a big road with 4 lanes. So depending on which side of the building your room is it can be a bit noisy from the street. But for me it was ok"
"This ST Signature Co-Living is newly opened in Beach Rd. I wanted to try the fresh double cabin room for my weekend getaway in SG. The modern minimalist design is quite nice. Comfy bed with clean linen, a desk with chair, wash basin and wide mirror, and bathroom with shower and good amenities. We can also enjoy the entertainment provided from a Smart TV inside the room. There is also self serviced pantry on level 6 where we can have coffee, tea or water.

Overall is good, even it__ not spacious, but it is a great choice for short staying and for a rest after exploring SG the whole day. Lastly, the rate is quite high, compare to 3-4 star hotels. I think if it__ cheaper it will be better ;)"
"Very small room. And the queen beds were easily breaks apart into two single sized bed when youre rolling on it which makes it very troublesome to keep putting it back. The top layer that is supposed to make the two beds feel like one also doesnt fit nicely so it was not very nice. Toilet was tiny but clean.  The tables were okay. There was this hidden compartment beside the queen bed that had some lamp on it which seems kinda useless I d rather use it to put my charging phones etc. The cook lab can be q dirty. The coffee machine was great but in the morning when it is empty you have to refill it yourselves (quite complex, we gave up trying). There are no toothbrushes etc provided so I had to buy one. The aircon was great. But soundproofing was terrible. I lived all the way at the end of the aisle, and everytime the room next to us opens or close their doors it felt like somebody was very rudely knocking our door. The staff were very nice and courteous so check in was a breeze, although note that the website is not ready for check in yet so you have to go level 2 to check in. All in all i think I could have stayed in a better hotel with the price."
Loved it here!! The location is great and the staff is super helpful and just lovely. Would stay again any time!
"I had an amazing stay, the location was great and the staff just so lovely and helpful! Even extended my stay for three more nights. I__l definitely come again!"
Clean and great location
place is great and host replies fast and is very accommodating
Great location and great spot. Book it!
"The hosts made this stay smooth. We had to change our booking days as we got our flight wrong! They were very good about it and helped with our lost luggage! The room is quite small but was good for us as we only needed a night. Honestly though, the places we stayed were around the same size and a bit more expensive and a bit worse than this. 

This was definitely a steal! Really enjoyed it. The bed was comfy and the shower was nice. The location is great, close to the station and the mall and various hot pot places! Definitely would come back and stay again :)"
"This is a great little spot in a great location.  Close to all the major attractions wether you take the subway or a cab it__ very affordable. There is also a ton of stuff, within a short walk. The building was quite and clean.  The room is small but was perfect for me as I didn__ have a lot of stuff.  I would definitely reboot if I was looking for a place downtown."
The place was Very small and the kitchen was outside upstairs very strange. The response to all the issues with the room was good but the issues really were too much and not solved at the time hence we lost a lot of sleep. We had very noisy people in the room near us until 2am + the next night sleep was lost due to an aircon vent being redirected through our rooms vents the next day we moved to another room and all was perfect until our cool room turned into a hot house due to another guest turning a switch off in THEIR ROOM. It was solved within an hour but when the guests returned at 22 mins passed midnight they switched it off again so we cooked again with no sleep again until it was sorted ....we were glad to get out of there to get some sleep which I  believe the point of airbnb to to allow guests to SLEEP
"I enjoyed my stay and will come back again in the near future. The room is very clean and perfect location. Also the host was quick response to message, question and trouble. They were great host!

the perfect location and a quiet place.

"A great place to stay. Location is just fine. I guess it__ hard to find something better for this price.
It was an interesting experience for me, cuz it was the first time when all the communication during my stay happened using telegram messenger. I got my keys, got answers to every question I had, and checked out without even seeing someone  
The room was clean and responses were fast. Plus the great location and comparably low price, so it was a good experience."
Best location and exceptionally clean room. I highly recommend this place! I'll be coming back again the next time I'm in Singapore.

En la Ãºltima planta dispone de una zona con una cocina, frigorÃ­fico, agua frÃ­a y caliente y cafÃ© gratis. Recomendamos este hotel 100% la calidad-precio es fabulosa. Si volvemos a Singapore, volveremos a este hotel sin dudarlo. Muchas gracias por la atenciÃ³n recibida"

Clean and comfy place to stay.
A comfortable space with great location and seamless check-in/out experience. The host is also very prompt in responding to messages.
All perfectly fine
"The place is very well located and easy to find,, Linda is very responsive and supportive thru messages as the place is self check in/out (We didn__ meet in person), I had an excellent time during my stay and hope to come back some day!
I recommend this place."
"Great and cheap place to stay for a few days. However, people who use the cooking lab should be more considerate in terms of washing the sink and the area. Other than that, it's a great place to stay!

ps: there's a lot of milk in the cooking lab, really appreciate it!  + a coffee machine"
"The place is very clean, cozy and the staff respond quickly to all queries. Great location, easy to access from Bugis with plenty of food places around. It would be great if the TV could access Netflix as currently there is a compatibility issue. Apart from that I think this is a perfect spot for a staycation. Thank you for hosting us :)"
Great place for the price
Good host that are willing to assist
Overall good stay
it__ really worth the money . The room is clean and it__ beautiful

"I am a semi regular guest at this co-living hotel and each time they seem to surpass the previous experience, from check in, to room atmosphere and level of cleanliness_then finally to check out out i cannot fault them, I will be returning! this is an example of a very well run hotel, the management needs to be congratulated. Thumbs up !"
Will definitely book again ! 
Room is small but cosy
"ST Signature @ Bugis Beach is definitely a great place to stay at. Encountered some check-in issues and the staff was quick to pick up the phone and resolve the matter immediately. The room was clean and cozy with good quality bed and pillows. 

Happened to chance upon on the host, Fang and she was super friendly and answered all of my questions as it was my first time staying there. It is a good location as there are many eateries and convenience stores around. It was definitely a good stay and would recommend anyone to stay there. 

Once again, thank you for your hospitality! :)"
Awesome place
Splendid

"Location is quite nice, a 3 minutes walking distance to Bugis Junction. However the door is at the back of the building. So sometimes not easy for driver to look for it"
A great place! :)
Great host and a cosy place to stay at. Would reccomend friends to stay.
.
You won't be disappointed. It is worth the price you'll be paying for. Place is clean and has the amenities you need during your stay.

"Really patient with all the inquiries I have, and being really detailed on how to check-in. Apart from that, they uses digital password lock which makes it easier for someone forgetful like me to use. 
The location is near MRT and near the malls, wonderful location."
nice and peaceful place to stay in !!!
"Very small, but affordable in a great location for a short stay.

We stayed here for 3 nights. Things to know: You check in online (they call it __hat-in_) and get a code to access your room. You can __hat-in_ a day before which is helpful. You need to upload a photo of your passport in order to check-in, so having a photo on your phone/computer before checking in is helpful. You check-out (__hat-out_)online when you leave. 
There are shared facilities on the top floor that we didn__ use.
Most communication with hotel staff is via (Hidden by Airbnb) , so it helps to have this app loaded before booking in. However I found the use of (Hidden by Airbnb) confusing as information didn__ seem to go through to the manager, only to hotel staff.

Pros: comfy bed, good hot shower, great hotel ground staff (e.g. quick to fix minor issues like noisy pipes, broken lift, providing a power adapter). Location is really great - endless food options around, near the Bugis MRT, easy access to airport.
Cons: very small, no window, limited space for large suitcases (but as shown in the photos - you know what you are getting). Fixed hangers and a lack of hooks for towels etc was frustrating. Aircon was good and quiet but blew directly on to the bed which I didn__ like. The building  itself is not secure - anyone can enter the building and lift, although room locks seem very secure. There is an overwhelming (fragrant) smell in the entrance (that may be trying to cover other smells?). 

Finally, we were disappointed that the manager was unsympathetic that we were unable to make our first night (due to pandemic related flight issues) and unwilling to provide us with a refund for that night. In normal circumstances this would be understandable, however this was a crisis situation."
Cheaper than most hotels around the area.

We will stay there again or other room from this host for upcoming trips to SG"
"We stayed here for 28days. Peter and his colleagues has been very nice, just let them know what to top up and they will do it immediately. Response is fast and clear as well. Will definitely stay again if i have the chance. Thanks for hosting us."
"The place was dirty,sticky floor, and the smelly cigarettes smells. After we check out, all our clothes and hair with the smelly cigarette smell. This is the terrible and worst stay experienced with airbnb stay."
Great place with easily accessible amenities and convenience to other parts of town. Really cool to have a pool right at the doorstep too. Host is very responsive and willing to offer help. Unit though generally needs a bit more thorough maintenance and cleanups.

It is clean and cozy. I enjoyed staying at Jo's place. The aircon was good too! Thank you for the great stay

"Highly recommend Mindy__ place! I was lucky to stay in this apartment when I first landed to Singapore. Mindy made everything feel like home. She is super nice, helpful and very responsive whenever I have questions. The place is located right in downtown and super easy to get around. 3-5mins to metro and 3 mins to bus stops. Tons of restaurants, coffee shops and convenient stores. Also, the view is amazing! Just love it!"

Anyone in Singapore should consider this for accommodation. I would love to avail this accommodation in future also."

Great location - stone's throw to many great facilities and transport. The host was very responsive and accommodative of special requests.
"Nice high level with good views, breezy, very comfortable, quiet, pleasant and cozy place,  very self-contained and complete. Responsive host who was very helpful through stay. On first day, noted that place was dusty and he responded immediately by organising a cleaner to improve the situation immediately. Rest of stay was very good! Thanks for hosting!"
The apartment is well suited for a short stay. It is compact with little room for moving about. The windows open towards the road and hence traffic noise should be expected. Ong is a good host and very responsive and accommodating.
"Nice place to stay, owner and his dad is very friendly. Recommended to stay"

"Place was spacious,easy access,clean
Nice to stay and affordable."
It was a good stay.
My girlfriend and I had a great stay. Everything was clean and new. We'd definitely would come back. Service was great too!
Lots of issues and had to constantly contact the management. Quite bad for the price.
The studio I was offered not exactly the same one as pictures shows but I don't have much to complain as it was well equipped and seems slightly bigger than the one in the photos. They have many other rooms and place is more like a hotel or service apartment than a private residence. Overall pleasant stay
Book only if you are ok with an unresponsive host. Wonder if the host cares at all? She must be so busy that she can__ even reply at all :)
"Room is generally clean, but there are some holes in the wall where the wires come out and also broken/loose window handles. But overall, room is worth the price you're paying, coupled with it's location. _ºï_"
Value for money
"nice place , private convenient and spacious."
The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
Nice!

As usual a great place for  short getaway.. room 304 has a longer room and kinda smaller bathroom. 307 has a bigger bathroom and slightly spacious as it has squarish layout.

"Love the style of the room and the cleanliness of the bathroom. Even though the room was quite small, it was very cosy and i had a good night's sleep in the very comfortable bed. The only thing that was lacking was a set of disposable toothbrush kit. Otherwise, the stay was perfect. Highly recommend."

"Clean and new room, it was very comfortable. Nice and quiet as well. Smart TV with Netflix included. My only complaint would be that shared electric stove area and washer. Washer is always in use so it was hard to find a time to wash my clothes. The pan is very old so the space wasn't really great for cooking. Other than that, no complaints."
Location was good. Host very responsive and provided easy to follow self checkin directions with pictures. Cleaner was friendly and Orientated me and checked that I was satisfied before leaving. Some other tenants live here. Didn__ get to see them but seemed that no one use them bathrooms
Nice and cosy staying place for rest and relax ..
"It__ a good experience as it__ my first time staying in an Airbnb. However, during my stay I actually experience having small roaches at the kitchen area. Also having water coming out from the electrical socket which causes some electricity waves. It__ pretty dangerous. The toilet sink is alittle clogged too as the water flow ain__ smooth. The room__ bad toilet door alittle faulty as it__ quite hard to lock/unlock. Also the glass door Can__ be closed fully. I saw the amenities stating there are salt and pepper provided but there isn__ any when I arrived. 
Other than that everything is fine, the TV is huge and comes along with Netflix. The bed is really comfy too  Toilet is clean, towels are provided and everything else was fine. Wardrobe is pretty big too. Should provide more toilet papers / tissues. As other than the toilet paper, there isn__ any other tissues avail. 
Once again it__ a good experience. Also good for 2 ppl "
best place for staycation..

Okay
"Easy to check-in and the location is great! However, walls are quite thin and the staff were quite noisy. But they lowered their voices after we told them.

"Once you get the hang of the ST Signature app, this place is going to be the most convenient hotel you__e gonna find. Haven__ found any other places that can compare to this yet."
Value for money. People whom are looking for few hours short stay just to rest or have got nowhere to go in the mean time and have few hours to spare while waiting can visit this place! Self check in it is very convenient. It would be better if the TV have Netflix for Beach Road branch.
Value for money stay. Perfect for a quick nap to recharge.
excellent would come again

K was an amazing host. Easily contactable. Asked him if there__ microwave and he got back to me by sending one to the apartment. Couldn__ be more thankful. Hope to stay there again someday!
Strategic location but poor soundproof system. Sofa and coffee table not in a good condition.
"Making arrangements and asking questions to K was full of ease.  He is a timely communicator.  When we arrived I asked K if it was possible to get a pot or rice cooker.  He said he would check and proceeded to ask if there were any other utensils we may like.  Within 30 minutes there was a brand new rice cooker at the door and a larger salad bowl. It was like magic!  There is a beautiful pool and common area with wifi so I was able to relax and answer emails from there.   Lots of restaurants, a convenient grocery store, and fruit stands in walking distance.  Thank you for letting us stay."
"Nice place, peaceful with extremely great and understanding host. Feels like just at home with a family."

Cozy room. Worth try
Friendly nice stay there
Its a really good space if you want to be alone and just get comfortable.
"Share toilet, kitchen"
Nicely place to stay .
Super cozy and would love to visit again some day (:
"Have stayed here numerous times and have always enjoyed it. Check in is very simple and seamless, takes less than 2 minutes. Units are clean and staff helpful. Great location and easy access to downtown and MRT station. Many restaurants nearby and a 7-11 next door. Has easy in and out access to street. I prefer units in the 2nd and 3rd floor but others are fine, just personal preference. Wifi can be spotty at times on 4th and 5th floors if you need it for work purposes like Zoom etc but casual use is fine. Do note that there is new a construction site on the back side of the building and might produce some noise. Was not operating while I was there so I dont really know. If this is a concern for you, maybe ask owner for a unit that's front facing. Pictures shown are very accurate. Will stay here again."
Nice place with window.
"; Thanks to the host's hospitality, my family had an enjoyable experience. We were amazed by almost everything!! Our first Airbnb booking and we will definitely be back for more. Thank you so much. "
"I booked to stay in this apartment with my family, it was perfect. The apartment is beautiful and comfortable and has everything we need. I was able to work from home and attend all my meetings with ease. Location is perfect: it__ on a quiet side street, but close to great eating spots, and the malls are just 5 minutes away for all our daily necessities. Peir is also extremely helpful and responsive and made sure we had a great stay. Highly recommended!"
"First of all, great owner, friendly and approachable. She gave us clear instructions for check in as well, fuss-free. 

The unit is located in a quaint area, surrounded by local food, convenience stores and heartland cinematic streets. 

In the airbnb you'll find yourself in comfort and ease. Bedding was great, it gave me a much needed night's sleep while being a picky person when it comes to mattresses.

The living room was great for chilling out with my pals too. It was quiet, cooling and peaceful at night. While in the morning, I could get hooked up on the wifi and get a few productive hours of work in with a cup of tea."
"Peir's apartment was brilliantly decorated, and Peir was an amazing host! She was extremely accommodating and was efficient in responding to our queries. Highly recommend this beautiful apartment :)"
"Peir is an amazing host - very responsive and accommodating. Check-in was easy and we had everything we needed. There is a new stove as well, which made for a very fun cooking experience with my friends. Place was clean and pretty too. Would definitely recommend the place!"
A really nice place. Recommended...
"Fantastic place Peir has it. 

Authentic 70s style kind of an apartment. 

Fast response from Peir and really accommodating to us. Instructions were clear. 

Definitely a place to stay again."
Place was amazing as always and Peir is a great host! Highly responsive and accommodating. Would definitely recommend this place.
The best place I had staycay and everyone who came loved it! The host was so kind and fast response to my msges. Even let us go check out late. She was the best host  definitely will book again
"Jenn is a great host. Directions to the apartment were clear, and the apartment was beautiful. Thank you Jenn!"
This is a great and stylish place  at a very good location. Perfect communication with Jenn

"I am utterly disappointed and disgusted by how the guests are being managed.
1) My check-in details were sent 15mins after the supposed check-in timing.
2) I was there approximately 2.20pm. Was made to sit outside and wait until 3pm until I__ able to check-in my room. Reason being, guests before us made a mess and checked out late. I asked for another room I just got a cold and unhelpful reply, __ll our rooms are fully booked_. I asked them for cancellation, no answer. The guy at the front desk then told me in a somewhat unhappy tone that __f that__ the case we allow you to check out late_.
Then this person whom I liaised with called __ean_ who helps manage their Airbnb bookings told me, __orry it__ not possible for you to check out late because we have back-to -back bookings._ - a clear case of extremely poor communication between the staffs.
So I get to be checked-in an hour late and I cannot check out late, with no form of compensation at all but their lousy excuses and weak apologises?
3) Sent me wifi password but no wifi log-in details. Searched high and Low around the room, nothing. Front desk is basically just for show because no one is there most of the time.
4) Room smells like a smoking den when I first stepped into it. Yes the poor cleaner tried her best to clean it out, and the previous guest __essed the place up really bad_; that__ the thing - if you don__ have spare rooms, your prev guest messed it up bad, and you have to make me wait an hour till I can successfully check-in, how about just sparing us all our time and give me a Full refund?
5) Room aircon automatically switched off in the middle of the night.

The apartment is alright. Not as big as it seems, definitely with character and is quaint and pretty but too bad the management skills is so bad. 
I__e never ever been to a services residence with such lousy customer service and management skills.
Good luck on your future bookings with them.


P/s : Oh ya don__ bother trying to call their numbers listed on the airbnb site or their check in emails. The numbers go straight to voicemail and I don__ know why they have their helpline numbers for."
Worth the price and nice place to stay in! Recommend it :)
Small and comfortable. Easy to locate and convenient.
So clean location good
"Great place, Great host. Thanks for hosting us, K!"
Room was very comfortable with a small cozy  balcony.
"It's a cozy place.A great privacy I had and She did provide me whatever  needed.
She gave me tips where to get foods and (Website hidden by Airbnb) Awesome Place for staycation."
"Is a nice place for relaxing. Room is clean. Ju was thoughtful and friendly

Very clean and neat place
Really nice spacious place for the price. 
Recommended. Convenience place
Great location at a great price
Great stay. Location is top notch and check in is easy.
Good location for a staycation. Jean was responsive to my messages. Will consider staying there again.
"This place is perfect for couple looking to immerse themselves in the busy city of Singapore.  The location is amazing, touching on many beautiful spots in Singapore with a few minutes of walk. In the evening, enjoy the plethora of pubs and the street art at club st.

The room was clean and I appreciate the smooth checking in. I was pleased to know that the sofa turns to a bed. This made the stay even more comfortable. The couch was suspiciously stained. 

My only complain is that the TV is useless. It is there but cannot access any channels. Making it a smart TV with chrome cast will make the experience better. Additional appliances could be added  like microiwave. It makes things easier for heating up."
"The host and staff was really helpful. The place was clean, and it felt just like home. Overall, I am really happy with my stay at Jean__ place. Highly recommended to other traveller who__ coming to Singapore, or even for locals who__ planning to relax and rejuvenate."
"Nothing to complain. Check in n out was hassle free. The stay was splendid, room is as expected. Will come again for sure."
Great location. Amazing restaurants nearby.
Clean and beautiful place!
"Place looks exactly like the photos, location was great and the place was nice and cozy. And the host gave fast responses."
"The hotel room is very interesting, I realize your hotel have many rooms, each room has different concept. Must try each room in the future."
The unit is nice. Its clean. Its big. Location is also good.

Awesome place within Central Area
Both location and room were fantastic! I wouldn't mind staying again in the near future
Great place to stay. Wonderful location. Clean and cozy!

The place is big and clean. Also nearby to restaurants and bars. Recommended
Nice place to stay.
"Bright. Cozy. Clean. Self check-in was easy. Good options of nice food and drinks nearby, from cheap local to up-market restaurants with all kinds of cuisine."
"getting a place to stay with Jean is easier than you think! with fast response, I managed to check in within 20 mins of coming across her post on AirBnB. The stay was super cozy and did I not mention clean? 10/10 would book again, highly recommended! :)"
clean and great location
Lovely place for a short getaway.
Jeans place is spacious and clean. It is conveniently located nearby the mrt station. We faced a little trouble entering the building at first but it was solved quickly and efficiently. A good location for a quick getaway. Recommended!
Very clean and comfortable apartment. Location is great. Highly recommended!
"The room was well equipped and spacious. Location is unbeatable, as we are smack in the middle of many amazing restaurants and bars. 

Service is limited, as our exchanges were mainly online. Nonetheless, no issues with check-in and out. Apartment was missing a chair when we arrived. Apart from that, all was perfect."
Good to stay in as mrts were all walking distance.
Location is good but the room was a bit dusty. The most irritating thing is the host was very slow on replying my message.
Not bad but quite noisy
"A bit lost when I get into the unit, no trash bin in the unit, no shampoo and body wash. only 3 dinning table instead of 4. Overall, good location and the apartment is clean and quiet."
"Location was super good. Lots of bars and food places to settle your meals. Kitchen items were all provided, good to cook simple meals if need be. Checking in was super easy and fast too."
"Superb location, lots of food options right at the door step and a 7-11 convenience store just a stone's throw away. Love the natural sunlight during the day although it can get a bit noisy due to nearby construction site. Towels and toilet papers are provided. Bring your own soap, shampoo, toothbrush and toothpaste. Overall a nice stay :)"
Excellent place to stay
"Great location and decent value. For anyone needing to work from home though, beware of the construction next door. Its very loud 7 to 7 Mon to Sat"

Great communication with host. Secluded and quiet place.
Nice area. Have a market and everything. Really convince for travelers to stay. And the host is friendly!
Good Location to access City and other places.
Ok
It__ a nice place and Benny has been really helpful. It was a great experience
Cozy place. Great location.
"Everything was good and expected, price paid was equivalent to what i want. Only downside for that day was that the host gave unspecific instructions, so we had to wait below for an hour before we could check in. Other than that, everything else was good! Recommend"
Nice and friendly guy
"Fortunately, host was friendly, easily contactable and reachable. However, the unit was not up to our expectations. Unlike the other airbnb we have been to, no basic necessities was provided (eg towels, toothbrush, toothpaste etc.) so please remember to bring your own. Old laundries was hung at the balcony, a small bottle of used body wash and shampoo was placed on the bathroom floor, giving us a very messy impression of the unit. Definitely not worth the money, $200+ per night. You can rent a better unit at a much more affordable price."
Enjoyed it well the place was really good but the kitchen does not have much accessories

Its a nice place to stay
"He gave me a different place than what I booked and its not better. I give him the benefit of the doubt that he told me the toilet tap flooded the place. Put this on record in case someone else experience the same thing.

And ya, I do not understand what other travelers mean that he is a ""responsive host"", because I did not any instructions from him and I have to call him at night before the check in day to be told ""it is confirmed and you will get the instructions on the check in day because I do not know what time you can check on"""
Worth the money
Lovely experience. Thank you very much!
Please kindly note that it is for day use only. Only suitable for couple for sex.
Nice place
Benny is a helpful host and is very prompt to assist his guests. Nice place to stay.

"At the beginning, it seems that the host was very attentive and helpful because I request for another one day to extend my stay and the place absolutely as in the photo,very spacious,and comfortable.  The only point that I want to highlight is that,it can be very loud and noisy at night and may cause disturbance while sleeping. Some tenant from other rooms was so noisy at night especially after 1am and until 4am in the morning. I was wondering if there is no quiet rules applied to customers as I can see that they are free to do everything they want. When I gave feedback to the host about this ,Jean didn't response and unlikely to (Website hidden by Airbnb) kinda disrespect as I did pay for my stays(although I was upset on 2nd day and checkout early a day before without continuing my extend)and was expecting good weekend experience at this place. Perhaps it just my unlucky day with not so good members of the residence during the time. Overall,the place was sparkling clean."
I enjoyed my stay at Hillary__ place which is very convenient. Hillary is an excellent host and very accommodating.
Top notch customer service. Very old -school apartment with a touch of modern theme. Huge and a very good palce for selfie. (Hidden by Airbnb) worthy.

Not to mention about hospitality, we can only said in 1 word...Great"
Great place
"Book at your own risk. Superhost? More like superHoax. Shady and dishonest host. HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND. 

1. Host Ken asked for a security deposit fee of $1000 to be transferred via paynow on the day of check-in. Per the sg airbnb website, hosts are not allowed to ask for payments including security deposits outside of the official Airbnb app. So that is already a violation of Airbnb__ terms and services. (But too bad i only found out abt this much later aftr i already paid).

2. I was disappointed as there was an additional surcharge of $75-$80 per additional guest and this wasn__ clearly stated in the listing until after I booked the place. Ken did state this amount ($75) for the additional guests via the airbnb message chats but changed it to $80 at a later date. 

3. Ken kept on promising to return the security deposit but took more than a week to get back to guest(me). See point 5 for elaboration.

4. Even so, Ken did not fully reimburse the $1000 deposit due to __amage of property_, claiming my friends and I destroyed his unicorn float. Quote // the head of the unicorn is broken//.
I have pictures and videos proving otherwise as my friends and I did not use the unicorn float at all. It was already defective even before we entered the house (we have videos). Host still insisted the defective float need to be compensated and cost $70. 

5.  Ken agreed to return the security deposit the day aftr checkout on 29th sep 2020, but only returned my money the following week on 7 Oct 2020. His excuse was that he was not back at his property (which to me was not a good justification because shouldn__ the listing be checked on the day itself of the check-out and not 1 week after?) I did not get my full deposit due to __roperty damage_ of the unicorn float,(see point 4) and additional pax (see point 2). 

What really appalled me was that Ken gave me the assurance that the security deposit was to be returned the day of the checkout on 29th sep, but kept delaying it, one day after another. 

Furthermore, I had to give daily reminders to Ken to return my money (aka security deposit). The feeling of having to beg for your own money made me really distressed and felt that my trust was betrayed. On 7 Oct (8 days after checkout), I was already too upset, as Ken still had not returned my deposit and regretfully agreed to points 2 and 4 as I just wanted my money back. Ken claimed i was even hostile to him via txt msges when i did not even cursed him or shout at him (i have screenshots). All i wanted was my money back.

6. Listing states i will have the whole bungalow but there were no notes in the description clearly stating host occupies the place too (2nd level onwards). Although we had the 1st floor and basement to ourselves, my friends and I felt a bit awkward. Again, i was disappointed.

7. The only good points were there were plenty of amenities, all fortunately working. The place was clean and well maintained. Host Ken was approachable in the beginning but it was all a facade as the experience was ruined by points 1 to 6. 


100% do not recommend to book this place. I have used airbnb for many places as I travel frequently overseas but this is the worst experience by far and sadly it happened in my own home country. Will not stay here again. My advise is to check the reviews first for the host__ other listings and there are similar sentiments, so i am definitely not exaggerating or lying."
Is a nice tidy place. And very great hosting from Leon. Thank u
Good and polite host.
"We had a fantastic stay. The place is Super nice, location is very convenient and the hosts are very kind and communicate very effectively. We__l surely return. Thanks"
"Lina was a fantastic host, quick to response and provided information in advance. Thoughtful as well for selecting the room with a nice view plus a high floor "
"Lina__ rates for a staycay at MBS was much cheaper than if I booked it via the hotel website. Value for money. She also helped to instruct her assistant to upgrade me to a higher floor and larger room as I was celebrating my wedding anniversary.  Appreciate it. As her assistant was the one handling the check in and check out, had to wait for some time before he arrived. Otherwise, Lina was very polite and responsive. Highly recommended!! MBS (Hidden by Airbnb) ark is lovely and I enjoyed myself a lot."
"Enjoyed my time spending the work week in this cosy, quiet place!"
Lina is a fantastic host! She upgrade our room which has high and beautiful scene. She is quick and promt in any responses. We tought that couldn't make it to the pool as bad weather occur but she keeps us updated so that we have the chance to expericence it.
"Lina was very responsive and answered all my queries before booking. We opted for the garden view and got what we requested. Overall, the stay was very enjoyable and I will definitely book with Lina again!"
"Beautiful place, just as amazing as seen in the pictures. The toilet has a really high ceiling and the spaces are all decked out for great photos! Superb location _ just a breezy 10 minutes walk away from old airport road and its famous claypot rice, xiao long bao and prawn noodles. Frank was helpful and responsive, and it was the most delightful stay. Will definitely recommend this listing to friends!"
"The unit is exactly the same as shown in the photos. Spacious, clean and cozy. Good view of the neighborhood from the 5th floor thru numerous glass windows. The best feature is the hawker food market just outside the back exit of the building. We enjoyed eating  all the local delicious food. Velvet, our host was also very accomodating. Would recommend this place to other travellers."
"Room was clean, wifi easy to connect. Didn't see others when staying here. Security is 24hr at lift lobby, friendly people. Well located with amenities and transport easily: chinatown mrt in basement here in 1 min, few bus stops and many buses here to bugis / raffles place easily. Can find halal food here easily also. very convenient."
Quick response and nice place.
It is spacious place. Suitable for family or big group of friends~
"The house is really smelly and the floor is very dirty and dust. 

The kitchen light spoilt."
Good location
Suitable for groups~ had a pleasant stay there~ will book again next time
Sure to come again :)
"the location is convenient, a 5 min walk to united square. the apartment is pretty much what the listing shows, but a little dirty. aircon is probably the only redeeming point, and probably the only area maintained properly in the entire house."

"Pleasant and nice stay... 
Although there were a little bit rushing on the check in time but David was responding fast to clear the hassle... 
The house was cozy, everything included as per listed. 
Location is super convenient, walking distance to all the good food... 
I had a super great and chill staycation at this place. 
Thanks David"
Wonderful city view. Friendly and responsive owner. Superb location and lots of good food around.
"Host was fast to respond from booking to checkin. THough never met host, assistant met up and guided. THe place looked exactly like the pictures. Whole building is really tall above #30, although building is old, security is new, apartment is renovated with touch-ups here and there. Location was perfect here, central of everywhere, Chinatown MRT is just below the basement, 1 min from apartment door step to mrt entrance. PLenty of buses along the bus stops of main roads here. few others lived in this shared apartment which is spacious with two storey, though i never met them. A little pantry corner available for light cooking of instant noodles, or boiling water for beverages. Felt very safe with some common areas cameras, not to mention the friendly lobby security. Room was clean and window view to great chinatown day and night view. U can see all the lovely lights of chinatown street amidst this lantern festivals. WOW. 7-eleven and other food stores available 24hrs, very convenient"
good overall
"This place is absolutely amazing!!! It is so huge and beautiful! The photos just doesn__ make any justice for this place. Once we drive through the gate, we feel that we are being transported to Bali. It__ really like going to a luxurious holiday without flying! The ambience is magical and make you feel at peace and so relaxing. The bungalow is so nicely decorated! Every details are taken care of. We enjoyed ourselves so much at the pool; bbq, wine and so much fun with total relaxation and privacy in the nature! So happy that I found this place, my family enjoyed themselves so much! We really didn__ want to leave. I would highly highly recommend this place. I would rate it best in getaway in Singapore , such a fabulous experience. It__ worth every penny. I have already requested to come back again end of the year. Finger cross that it is available."
